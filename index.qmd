# Preface {.unnumbered}

This text is constructed from the narrative documents that supported each learning module in the ENVS 543 Environmental Data Literacy course taught at Virginia Commonwealth University in the Fall of 2024.

> Semester course; 3 lecture hours. 3 credits. Enrollment is restricted to students with graduate standing or those with one course in statistics and permission of instructor. Develop quantitative skills for the visualization, manipulation, analysis, and communication of environmental "big data." This course focuses on spatial environmental data analysis, interpretation, and communication, using real-time data from the Rice Rivers Center and the R statistical analysis environment.

## Workflow & Data Analysis

To understand data analytics, one needs to recognize the entire workflow. Below is a brief graphical depiction of how analysis actualin the real world. In this class, we will work on all of the components using the open-source R language.

-   Collect: Getting data from an external source into a format that you use is often the most time-consuming step in the analysis. The content of this class will provide training in data import from local, online, and database sources.\
-   Visualize: Visualizing data is key to understanding. In the image below, notice that the variables X and Y in all the displayed data sets have equivalent means, standard deviations, and correlation up to 2 decimal places! We will emphasize visualization, both static and dynamic, throughout this class.\
-   Transform: Pulling data into your analysis ecosystem is not sufficient. Often the data need to be reformatted and reconfigured before it is actually used.\
-   Model: The application of models to subsets of data is often the step that takes the least amount of effort. However, the application of a model to data is not the endpoint. The model must be visualized and, many times, the underlying data or derivate data must be transformed and submitted to subsequent models.\
-   Communicate: The effort we put into research and analyses is meaningless without effective communication of your data and findings to a broad audience. Here, we will focus on how to develop effective data communication strategies and formats.

## Learning Objectives

The purpose of this course is to help you build your data skills and to develop a foundational understanding upon which subsequent courses will build. The overarching goal here is to develop a working knowledge of the R statistical computing language and enough proficiency to import raw data and then iterate through the visualization, manipulation, and analysis steps in the creation of output that is easily communicated to a scientific audience.

The content of this course is built upon the following general student learning objectives (SLO):

-   SLO 1: Identity, manipulate, and summarize numerical, categorical, ordinal, logical, date, string, and spatial data types.
-   SLO 2: Create habits and took the knowledge to support reproducible research.
-   SLO 3: Create an informative and effective graphical display of various data types of suitable quality for inclusion in published manuscripts.
-   SLO 4: Effectively choose appropriate statistical models based on the types of data at hand and the questions being addressed.
-   SLO 5: Demonstrate a general understanding of spatial data types and the creation of both appropriate static and dynamic maps.

## Course Content & Assessment

This course is designed as a sequence of individual, stand-alone modules. Each is self-contained and includes a lecture, slides, a larger narrative document, a video demonstration, and an assessment.
