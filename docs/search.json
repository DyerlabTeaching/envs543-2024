TYou can envision a raster just like an image. When me make a leaflet() map and how the tiles, each pixel is colored a particular value representing elevation, temperature, precipitation, habitat type, or whatever. This is exactly the same for rasters. The key point here is that each pixel represents some defined region on the earth and as such the raster itself is georeferenced. It has a coordinate reference system (CRS), boundaries, etc."

    "text": "Making Rasters de novo\nA raster is simply a matrix with rows and columns and each element has a value associated with it. You can create a raster de novo by making a matrix of data and filling it with values, then turning it into a raster.\nHere I make a raster with random numbrers selected from the Poisson Distribution (fishy, I know) using the rpois() function. I then turn it into a matrix with 7 rows (and 7 columns).\n\nvals &lt;- rpois(49, lambda=12)\nx &lt;- matrix( vals, nrow=7)\nx\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7]\n[1,]    9   11   11    9    6    9   13\n[2,]   11   14   11   12   13    7   12\n[3,]   16   12   10   11   10   14    8\n[4,]   14   10   17   10   15   20   10\n[5,]   15   10   10    5   17   13   11\n[6,]   14   12    7    8   16    7    8\n[7,]    8   15   13   11   11   12   13\n\n\nWhile we haven’t used matrices much thus far, it is a lot like a data.frame with respect to getting and setting values using numerical indices. For example, the value of the 3rd row and 5th column is:\n\nx[3,5]\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nTo convert this set of data, as a matrix, into a geospatially referenced raster() object we do the following:\n\nr &lt;- raster( x )\nr\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 7, 7, 49  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.1428571, 0.1428571  (x, y)\nextent     : 0, 1, 0, 1  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : NA \nsource     : memory\nnames      : layer \nvalues     : 5, 20  (min, max)\n\n\nNotice that when I plot it out, it does not show the data, but a summary of the data along with some key data about the contents, including:\n- A class definition\n- The dimensions of the underlying data matrix,\n- The resolution (e.g., the spatial extent of the sides of each pixel). Since we have no CRS here, it is equal to \\(nrows(x)^{-1}\\) and \\(ncols(x)^{-1}\\).\n- The extent (the bounding box) and again since we do not have a CRS defined it just goes from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). - The crs (missing) - The source can be either memory if the raster is not that big or out of memory if it is just referencing.\nIf these data represent something on the planet, we can assign the dimensions and CRS values to it and use it in our normal day-to-day operations."

If we over 10 million missing data points (the ocean) and most of Mexico in this raster above but we are only working with sites in Baja California (Norte y Sur), we would do well to excise (or crop) the raster to only include the area we are interested in working with.\nTop do this, we need to figure out a bounding box (e.g., the minimim and maximum values of longitude and latitude that enclose our data).

This means that the minimum and maximum values for these points are defined by the original locations—for both the latitude and longitude (both minimum and maximum)—we have sites on each of the edges. This is fine here but we could probably add a little bit of a buffer around that bounding box so that we do not have our sites on the very edge of the plot. We can do this by either eyeballing-it to round up to some reasonable area around the points or apply a buffer (st_buffer) to the union of all the points with some distance and then take the boounding box. I’ll go for the former and make it into an extent object.\n\nbaja_extent &lt;- extent( c(-116, -109, 22, 30 ) )\nbaja_extent\n\nclass      : Extent \nxmin       : -116 \nxmax       : -109 \nymin       : 22 \nymax       : 30 \n\n\nThen we can crop() the original raster using this extent object to create our working raster. I can then dump my points onto the same raster plot by indicaating add=TRUE\n\nalt &lt;- crop( r, baja_extent )\nplot(alt)\nplot( beetles[\"Suitability\"], pch=16, add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⚠️\n\n\n\n   \n\n\nYou need to be careful here. When you use built-in graphics processes in a markdown document such as this and intend to add subsequent plots to an existing plot you cannot run the lines individual. They must be all executed as the whole chunk. So there is no CTRL/CMD + RETURN action here, it will plot the first one and then complain throughout the remaining ones saying something like plot.new has not been called yet. So you have to either knit the whole document or just run the whole chunk to get them to overlay."

The main thing here is that ggplot requires a data.frame object and a raster is not a data.frame — Unless we turn it into one (hehehe) using a cool function called rasterToPoints(). This takes the cells of the raster (and underlying matrix) and makes points from it.\n\nalt %&gt;%\n  rasterToPoints() %&gt;%\n  head()\n\n             x        y alt_22\n[1,] -115.7958 29.99583     55\n[2,] -115.7875 29.99583    126\n[3,] -115.7792 29.99583     94\n[4,] -115.7708 29.99583     99\n[5,] -115.7625 29.99583    106\n[6,] -115.7542 29.99583    120\n\n\nHowever, they are not a data.frame but a matrix.\n\nalt %&gt;%\n  rasterToPoints() %&gt;%\n  class()\n\n[1] \"matrix\" \"array\" \n\n\nSo, if we are going to use this, w need to transform it from a matrix object into a data.frame object. We can do this using the as.data.frame() function. Remember from the lecture on data.frame objects that we can coerce columns of data (either matrix or array) into a data.frame this way.\nSo here it is in one pipe, using the following tricks:\n- Converting raster to points and then to data.frame so it will go into ggplot\n- Renaming the columns of data I am going to keep so I don’t have to make xlab and ylab\n\nalt %&gt;%\n  rasterToPoints() %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame() %&gt;% \n  transmute(Longitude=x,\n            Latitude=y,\n            Elevation=alt_22)  -&gt; alt.df\nhead( alt.df )\n\n  Longitude Latitude Elevation\n1 -115.7958 29.99583        55\n2 -115.7875 29.99583       126\n3 -115.7792 29.99583        94\n4 -115.7708 29.99583        99\n5 -115.7625 29.99583       106\n6 -115.7542 29.99583       120\n\n\nThen we can plot it by:\n- Plotting it using geom_raster() and setting the fill color to the value of elevation. - Making the coordinates equal (e.g., roughtly equal in area for longitude and latitude), and - Applying only a minimal theme.\n\nalt.df %&gt;%\n  ggplot()  + \n  geom_raster( aes( x = Longitude, \n                    y = Latitude, \n                    fill = Elevation) ) + \n  coord_equal() +\n  theme_minimal() -&gt; baja_elevation\n\nbaja_elevation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat looks good but we should probably do something with the colors. There is a built-in terrain.colors() and tell ggplot to use this for the fill gradient.\n\nbaja_elevation + \n  scale_fill_gradientn( colors=terrain.colors(100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr you can go dive into colors and set your own, you can set up your own gradient for ggplot using independent colors and then tell it where the midpoint is along that gradient and it will do the right thing©.\n\nbaja_elevation + \n  scale_fill_gradient2( low = \"darkolivegreen\",\n                        mid = \"yellow\",\n                        high = \"brown\", \n                        midpoint = 1000 ) -&gt; baja_map\nbaja_map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that looks great. Now, how about overlaying the points onto the plot and indicate the size of the point by the ♂♀ ratio.\n\nbaja_map + \n  geom_sf( aes(size = MFRatio ), \n           data = beetles, \n           color = \"dodgerblue2\",\n           alpha = 0.75) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that looks nice."

This allows us to do normal R like data manipulations on the underlying data.\nConsider the following question.\n\nWhat are the parts of Baja California that are within 100m of the elevation of site named San Francisquito (sfran)?\n\nTo answer this, we have the following general outline of operations.\n\nFind the coordinates of the site named sfran\n\nExtract the elevation from the alt raster that is within 100m (+/-) of that site.\nPlot the whole baja data as a background\n\nOverlay all the locations within that elevation band.\n\nTo do this we will use both the alt and the beetles data objects.\nFirst, we find out the coordinates of the site.\n\nsfran &lt;- beetles$geometry[ beetles$Site == \"sfran\"]\nsfran\n\nGeometry set for 1 feature \nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -112.964 ymin: 27.3632 xmax: -112.964 ymax: 27.3632\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nPOINT (-112.964 27.3632)\n\n\nNow, we need to figure out what the value of elevation in the alt raster is at this site. This can be done with the extract() function from the raster library.\nHowever, the this function doesn’t work directly with sf objects so we need to cast it into a Spatial object1. Fortunatly, that is a pretty easy coercion.\n\nraster::extract(alt, as(sfran,\"Spatial\") ) \n\n[1] 305\n\n\n\nWarning: in the above code, I used the function extract() to extract the data from the alt raster for the coordinate of the target locale. However, there is also an extract() function that has been brought in from the dplyr library (as part of tidyverse). In this file, I loaded library(raster) before library(tidyverse) and as such the dplyr::extract() function has overridden the one from raster—they cannot both be available. As a consequence, I use the full name of the function with package::function when I call it as raster::extract() to remove all ambiguity. If I had not, I got a message saying something like, Error in UseMethod(\"extract_\") : no applicable method for 'extract_' applied to an object of class \"c('RasterLayer', 'Raster', 'BasicRaster')\". Now, I know there is an extract() function in raster so this is the dead giveaway that it has been overwritten by a subsequent library call.\n\n\nOption 1 - Manipulate the Raster\nTo work on a raster directly, we can access the values within it using the values() function (I know, these statistican/programmers are quite cleaver).\nSo, to make a copy and make only the values that are +/- 100m of sfran we can.\n\nalt_band &lt;- alt\nvalues( alt_band )[ values(alt_band) &lt;= 205 ] &lt;- NA\nvalues( alt_band )[ values(alt_band) &gt;= 405 ] &lt;- NA\nalt_band\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 960, 840, 806400  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.008333333, 0.008333333  (x, y)\nextent     : -116, -109, 22, 30  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs \nsource     : memory\nnames      : alt_22 \nvalues     : 206, 404  (min, max)\n\n\nThen we can plot overlay plots of each (notice how I hid the legend for the first alt raster).\n\nplot( alt, col=\"gray\", legend=FALSE, xlab=\"Longitude\", ylab=\"Latitude\")\nplot( alt_band, add=TRUE )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2 - Manipulate the Data Frames\nWe can also proceed by relying upon the data.frame objects representing the elevation. So let’s go back to our the alt.df object and use that in combination with a filter and plot both data.frame objects (the outline of the landscape in gray and the elevation range as a gradient). I then overlay the beetle data with the ratios as sizes and label the locales with ggrepel.

To describe this, consider a set of hypothetical random models with random values estimated for both the intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) and slope (\\(\\beta_1\\)) coefficients. These could be close to a good models or not.\n\nmodels &lt;- data.frame( beta0 = runif(250,-20,40),\n                      beta1 = runif(250, -5, 5))\nsummary( models )\n\n     beta0             beta1         \n Min.   :-19.818   Min.   :-4.88090  \n 1st Qu.: -4.211   1st Qu.:-2.32594  \n Median :  7.307   Median : 0.41508  \n Mean   :  8.938   Mean   : 0.09184  \n 3rd Qu.: 21.423   3rd Qu.: 2.51271  \n Max.   : 39.838   Max.   : 4.99674  \n\n\nWe can plot these and the original data and all these randomly defined models.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_abline( aes(intercept = beta0, \n                   slope = beta1), \n               data = models,\n               alpha = 0.1) + \n  geom_point( aes(x,y), \n              data=df )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA least squares fit is one that minimizes the distances of each point (in the y-axis) from the line created by the model. In the graph below, we can see this would be the distances (squared so we do not have positive and negative values) along the y-axis, between each point and the fitted line.\nThe “best model” here is one that minimizes the sum of squared distances distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at those hypothetical models. I’m going to make a few little functions to help make the code look easy.\nFirst, here is a function that returns the distances between the original points and a hypothesized regression line defined by an interscept and slope from the original points.\n\nmodel_distance &lt;- function( interscept, slope, X, Y ) {\n  yhat &lt;- interscept + slope * X\n  diff &lt;- Y - yhat\n  return( sqrt( mean( diff ^ 2 ) ) )\n}\n\nNow, let’s go through all the models and estimate the mean squared distances between the proposed line (from intercept and slope) and the original data.\n\nmodels$dist &lt;- NA\nfor( i in 1:nrow(models) ) {\n  models$dist[i] &lt;- model_distance( models$beta0[i],\n                                    models$beta1[i],\n                                    df$x,\n                                    df$y )\n}\nhead( models )\n\n        beta0      beta1     dist\n1 -18.0424238 -0.7089463 54.76088\n2 -14.5230405 -2.2438343 60.45797\n3 -14.8760956  3.4910115 28.00275\n4   0.8895328  1.4329755 23.78762\n5  13.7838388 -2.1500457 33.18651\n6 -15.4336788  1.2757150 40.66309\n\n\nIf we look through these models, we can see which are better than others by sorting in increasing squared distance.\n\nggplot()  + \n  geom_abline( aes(intercept = beta0,\n                   slope = beta1, \n                   color = -dist),\n               data = filter( models, rank(dist) &lt;= 10 ),\n               alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_point( aes(x,y),\n              data=df) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese models in the parameter space of intercepts and slopes can be visualized as this. These red-circles are close to where the best models are located.\n\nggplot( models, aes(x = beta0, \n                    y = beta1,\n                    color = -dist)) + \n  geom_point( data = filter( models, rank(dist) &lt;= 10), \n              color = \"red\",\n              size = 4) +\n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to a random search, we can be a bit more systematic about it and make a grid of interscept and slope values, using a grid search.\n\ngrid &lt;- expand.grid( beta0 = seq(15,20, length = 25),\n                     beta1 = seq(2, 3.5, length = 25))\ngrid$dist &lt;- NA\nfor( i in 1:nrow(grid) ) {\n  grid$dist[i] &lt;- model_distance( grid$beta0[i],\n                                  grid$beta1[i],\n                                  df$x,\n                                  df$y )\n}\n\nggplot( grid, aes(x = beta0, \n                  y = beta1,\n                  color = -dist)) + \n  geom_point( data = filter( grid, rank(dist) &lt;= 10), \n              color = \"red\",\n              size = 4) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could imagine that we could iteratively soom in this grid and find the best fit combination of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) values until we converged on a really well fit set.\nThere is a more direct way to get to these results (though is much less pretty to look at) using the lm() linear models function."

These are:\n\nThe P-value: Models with smaller probabilities could be considered more informative.\nThe \\(R^2\\): Models that explain more of the variation may be considered more informative.\n\nLet’s start by looking at some airquality data we have played with previously when working on data.frame objects.\n\nairquality %&gt;%\n  select( -Month, -Day ) -&gt; df.air\nsummary( df.air )\n\n     Ozone           Solar.R           Wind             Temp      \n Min.   :  1.00   Min.   :  7.0   Min.   : 1.700   Min.   :56.00  \n 1st Qu.: 18.00   1st Qu.:115.8   1st Qu.: 7.400   1st Qu.:72.00  \n Median : 31.50   Median :205.0   Median : 9.700   Median :79.00  \n Mean   : 42.13   Mean   :185.9   Mean   : 9.958   Mean   :77.88  \n 3rd Qu.: 63.25   3rd Qu.:258.8   3rd Qu.:11.500   3rd Qu.:85.00  \n Max.   :168.00   Max.   :334.0   Max.   :20.700   Max.   :97.00  \n NA's   :37       NA's   :7                                       \n\n\nLet’s assume that we are interested in trying to explain the variation in Ozone (the response) by one or more of the other variables as predictors.\n\nfit.solar &lt;- lm( Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = df.air )\nanova( fit.solar )\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: Ozone\n           Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \nSolar.R     1  14780 14779.7  15.053 0.0001793 ***\nResiduals 109 107022   981.9                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nLet’s look at all the predictors and take a look at both the p-value and R-squared.\n\nfit.temp &lt;- lm( Ozone ~ Temp, data = df.air )\nfit.wind &lt;- lm( Ozone ~ Wind, data = df.air )\n\ndata.frame( Model = c( \"Ozone ~ Solar\",\n                       \"Ozone ~ Temp\",\n                       \"Ozone ~ Wind\"), \n            R2 = c( summary( fit.solar )$r.squared,\n                    summary( fit.temp )$r.squared,\n                    summary( fit.wind )$r.squared ), \n            P = c( get_pval( fit.solar), \n                   get_pval( fit.temp ),\n                   get_pval( fit.wind ) ) ) -&gt; df.models\n\ndf.models %&gt;%\n  arrange( -R2 ) %&gt;%\n  mutate( P = format( P, scientific=TRUE, digits=3)) %&gt;%\n  kable( caption = \"Model parameters predicting mean ozone in parts per billion mresured in New York during the period of 1 May 2973 - 30 September 2973.\",\n         digits = 3) %&gt;%\n  kable_minimal()\n\n\nModel parameters predicting mean ozone in parts per billion mresured in New York during the period of 1 May 2973 - 30 September 2973.\n\n\nModel\nR2\nP\n\n\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp\n0.488\n0.00e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Wind\n0.362\n9.27e-13\n\n\nOzone ~ Solar\n0.121\n1.79e-04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if we look at these results, we see that in both \\(R^2\\) and \\(P\\), the model with Temp seems to be most explanatory as well as having the lowest probability.

We are getting more variance explained by adding more predictor variables. In fact, by adding any variable, whether they are informative or not, one can explain some amount of the Sums of Squares in a model. Taken to the extreme, this means that we could add an infinite number of explanatory variables to a model and explain all the variation there is!\nHere is an example using our small data set. I’m going to make several models, one of which is the original one and the remaining add one more predeictor varible that is made up of a random variables. We will then look at the \\(R^2\\) of each of these models.\n\nrandom.models  &lt;- list()\nrandom.models[[\"Ozone ~ Temp\"]] &lt;- fit.temp\nrandom.models[[\"Ozone ~ Wind\"]] &lt;- fit.wind\nrandom.models[[\"Ozone ~ Solar\"]] &lt;- fit.solar\nrandom.models[[\"Ozone ~ Temp + Wind\"]] &lt;- fit.temp.wind\nrandom.models[[\"Ozone ~ Temp + Solar\"]] &lt;- fit.temp.solar\nrandom.models[[\"Ozone ~ Wind + Solar\"]] &lt;- fit.wind.solar\nrandom.models[[ \"Ozone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar\" ]] &lt;- fit.all\n\ndf.tmp &lt;- df.air\n\nfor( i in 1:8 ) {\n  lbl &lt;- paste(\"Ozone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar + \", i, \" Random Variables\", sep=\"\")\n  df.tmp[[lbl]] &lt;- rnorm( nrow(df.tmp) )\n  random.models[[lbl]] &lt;- lm( Ozone ~ ., data = df.tmp ) \n}\n\ndata.frame( Models = names( random.models ),\n            R2 = sapply( random.models, \n                          FUN = function( x ) return( summary( x )$r.squared), \n                          simplify = TRUE ),\n            P = sapply( random.models, \n                        FUN = get_pval ) ) -&gt; df.random\n\ndf.random %&gt;%\n  kable( caption = \"Fraction of variation explained by original variable as well as models with incrementally more predictor variables made up of randomly derived data.\",\n         digits=4,\n         row.names = FALSE ) %&gt;%\n  kable_paper(\"striped\", full_width = FALSE )\n\n\nFraction of variation explained by original variable as well as models with incrementally more predictor variables made up of randomly derived data.\n\n\nModels\nR2\nP\n\n\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp\n0.4877\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Wind\n0.3619\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Solar\n0.1213\n2e-04\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind\n0.5687\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Solar\n0.5103\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Wind + Solar\n0.4495\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar\n0.6059\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar + 1 Random Variables\n0.6268\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar + 2 Random Variables\n0.6305\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar + 3 Random Variables\n0.6305\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar + 4 Random Variables\n0.6308\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar + 5 Random Variables\n0.6442\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar + 6 Random Variables\n0.6443\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar + 7 Random Variables\n0.6462\n0e+00\n\n\nOzone ~ Temp + Wind + Solar + 8 Random Variables\n0.6494\n0e+00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if we just add random data to a model, we get a better fit!!!!

    "text": "Model Fitting\nTo get around this, we have a few tools at our disposal. The most common approach is to look at the information content in each model relative to the amount of pedictor variables. In essence, we must punish ourselves for adding more predictors so that we do not all run around and add random data to our models. The most common one is called Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and provide a general framework for comparing several models.\n\\[\nAIC = -2 \\ln L + 2p\n\\]\nWhere \\(L\\) is the log likelihood estimate of the variance and \\(p\\) is the number of parameters. What this does is allow you to evaluate different models with different subsets of parameters. In general, the best model is the one with the smallest value for AIC.\nWe can also evaluate the relative values of all the models by looking in the difference between the “best” model and the rest by taking the difference\n\\[\n\\delta AIC = AIC - min(AIC)\n\\]\nThe prevailing notion is that models that have \\(\\delta AIC &lt; 2.0\\) should be considered as almost equally informative, where as those whose \\(\\delta AIC &gt; 5.0\\) are to be rejected as being informative.

    "text": "Numerical Data\n\nNumerical data contains all numerical represenations.\n\nBy far, the most common kind of data we use in our analyses is numerical data. This may represent measured things like height, snout-vent length (whatever that is), depth, age, etc. In data analysis, we commonly take (or obtain) measurements from several items and then try to characterize them using summaries and visualization.\nIn R, the numerical data type can be defined as:\n\nX &lt;- 42\n\nNotice how the numerical value of 42 is assigned to the variable named X. To have R print out the value of a particular variable, you can type its name in the console and it will give it to you.\n\nX\n\n[1] 42\n\n\n\nOperators\nNumeric types have a ton of normal operators that can be used. Some examples include:\nThe usual arithmetic operators:\n\nx &lt;- 10\ny &lt;- 23\n\nx + y\n\n[1] 33\n\nx - y\n\n[1] -13\n\nx * y\n\n[1] 230\n\nx / y\n\n[1] 0.4347826\n\n\nYou have the exponential:\n\n## x raised to the y\nx^y\n\n[1] 1e+23\n\n## the inverse of an exponent is a root, here is the 23rd root of 10\nx^(1/y)\n\n[1] 1.105295\n\n\nThe logarithmic:\n\n## the natural log\nlog(x)\n\n[1] 2.302585\n\n## Base 10 log\nlog(x,base=10)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nAnd the modulus operator:\n\ny %% x\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nIf you didn’t know what this one is, don’t worry. The modulus is just the remainder after division like you did in grade school. The above code means that 23 divided by 10 has a remainder of 3. I include it here just to highlight the fact that many of the operators that we will be working with in R are created by more than just a single symbol residing at the top row of your computer keyboard. There are just too few symbos on the normal keyboard to represent the breath of operators. The authors of R have decided that using combinations of symbols to handle these and you will get used to them in not time at all.\n\n\nIntrospection & Coercion\nThe class() of a numeric type is (wait for it)… numeric (those R programmers are sure clever).\n\nclass( 42 )\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\nIn this case class is the name of the function and there are one or more things we pass to that function. These must be enclosed in the parenthesis associated with class. The parantheses must be right next to the name of the function. If you put a space betwen the word class and the parentheses, it may not work the way you would like it to. You’ve been warned.\nThe stuff inside the parenthesis are called arguments and are the data that we pass to the function itself. In this case we pass a value or varible to the class function and it does its magic and tells us what kind of data type it is. Many functions have several arguements that can be passed to them, some optional, some not. We will get more into that on the lecture covering Functions.\n\nIt is also possible to inquire if a particular variable is of a certain class. This is done by using the is.* set of functions.\n\nis.numeric( 42 )\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis.numeric( \"dr dyer\" )\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nSometimes we may need to turn one kind of class into another kind. Consider the following:\n\nx &lt;- \"42\"\nis.numeric( x )\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nclass(x)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIt is a character data type because it is enclosed within a set of quotes. However, we can coerce it into a numeric type by:\n\ny &lt;- as.numeric( x )\nis.numeric( y )\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ny\n\n[1] 42"

    "text": "Character Data\n\nCharacter data represents textual content.\n\nThe data type character is intended to represent textual data such as actual texts, names of objects, and other contnet that is intended to help both you and the audience you are trying to reach better understand your data.\n\nname &lt;- \"Dyer\"\nsport &lt;- \"Frolf\"\n\nThe two variables above have a sequence of characters enclosed by a double quote. You can use a single quote instead, however the enclosing quoting characters must be the same (e.g., you cannot start with a single quote and end with a double).\n\nLengths\nThe length of a string is a measure of how many varibles there are, not the number of characters within it. For example, the length of dyer is\n\nlength(name)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nbecause it only has one character but the number of characters within it is:\n\nnchar(name)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nLength is defined specifically on the number of elements in a vector, and technically the variable dyer is a vector of length one. If we concatinate them into a vector (go see the vector content)\n\nphrase &lt;- c( name, sport )\n\nwe find that it has a length of 2\n\nlength(phrase)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nAnd if we ask the vector how many characters are in the elements it contains, it gives us a vector of numeric types representing the number of letters in each of the elements.\n\nnchar(phrase)\n\n[1] 4 5\n\n\n\n\nPutting Character Objects Together\nThe binary + operator has not been defined for objects of class character, which is understandable once we consider all the different ways we may want to put the values contained in the variables together. If you try it, R will complain.\n\nname + sport\n\nError in name + sport: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nThe paste() function is designed to take a collection of character variables and smush them togethers. By default, it inserts a space between each of the variables and/or values passed to it.\n\npaste( name, \"plays\", sport )\n\n[1] \"Dyer plays Frolf\"\n\n\nAlthough, you can have any kind of separator you like:\n\npaste(name, sport, sep=\" is no good at \")\n\n[1] \"Dyer is no good at Frolf\"\n\n\nThe elements you pass to paste() do not need to be held in variables, you can put quoted character values in there as well.\n\npaste( name, \" the \", sport, \"er\", sep=\"\") \n\n[1] \"Dyer the Frolfer\"\n\n\nIf you have a vector of character types, by default, it considers the pasting operation to be applied to every element of the vector.\n\npaste( phrase , \"!\")\n\n[1] \"Dyer !\"  \"Frolf !\"\n\n\nHowever if you intention is to take the elements of the vector and paste them together, then you need to specify that using the collapse optional argument. By default, it is set to NULL, and that state tells the function to apply the paste()-ing to each element. However, if you set collapse to something other than NULL, it will use that to take all the elements and put them into a single response.\n\npaste( phrase, collapse = \" is not good at \") \n\n[1] \"Dyer is not good at Frolf\"\n\n\n\n\nString Operations\nMany times, we need to extract components from within a longer character element. Here is a longer bit of text as an example.\n\ncorpus &lt;- \"An environmental impact statement (EIS), under United States environmental law, is a document required by the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for certain actions 'significantly affecting the quality of the human environment'.[1] An EIS is a tool for decision making. It describes the positive and negative environmental effects of a proposed action, and it usually also lists one or more alternative actions that may be chosen instead of the action described in the EIS. Several U.S. state governments require that a document similar to an EIS be submitted to the state for certain actions. For example, in California, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be submitted to the state for certain actions, as described in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). One of the primary authors of the act is Lynton K. Caldwell.\"\n\n\n\nSplits\nWe can split the original string into several components by specifying which particular character or set of characters we wish to use to break it apart.\nAs we start working with increasingly more complicated string operations, I like to use a higher-level library (part of tidyverse) called stringr. If you do not have this library already installed, you can install it using install.packages(\"stringr\").\n\nlibrary( stringr )\n\nHere is an example using the space character to pull it apart into words.\n\nstr_split( corpus, pattern=\" \", simplify=TRUE)\n\n     [,1] [,2]            [,3]     [,4]        [,5]     [,6]    [,7]    \n[1,] \"An\" \"environmental\" \"impact\" \"statement\" \"(EIS),\" \"under\" \"United\"\n     [,8]     [,9]            [,10]  [,11] [,12] [,13]      [,14]      [,15]\n[1,] \"States\" \"environmental\" \"law,\" \"is\"  \"a\"   \"document\" \"required\" \"by\" \n     [,16] [,17]  [,18]      [,19]           [,20]    [,21] [,22]    [,23]\n[1,] \"the\" \"1969\" \"National\" \"Environmental\" \"Policy\" \"Act\" \"(NEPA)\" \"for\"\n     [,24]     [,25]     [,26]            [,27]       [,28] [,29]     [,30]\n[1,] \"certain\" \"actions\" \"'significantly\" \"affecting\" \"the\" \"quality\" \"of\" \n     [,31] [,32]   [,33]              [,34] [,35] [,36] [,37] [,38]  [,39]\n[1,] \"the\" \"human\" \"environment'.[1]\" \"An\"  \"EIS\" \"is\"  \"a\"   \"tool\" \"for\"\n     [,40]      [,41]     [,42] [,43]       [,44] [,45]      [,46] [,47]     \n[1,] \"decision\" \"making.\" \"It\"  \"describes\" \"the\" \"positive\" \"and\" \"negative\"\n     [,48]           [,49]     [,50] [,51] [,52]      [,53]     [,54] [,55]\n[1,] \"environmental\" \"effects\" \"of\"  \"a\"   \"proposed\" \"action,\" \"and\" \"it\" \n     [,56]     [,57]  [,58]   [,59] [,60] [,61]  [,62]         [,63]     [,64] \n[1,] \"usually\" \"also\" \"lists\" \"one\" \"or\"  \"more\" \"alternative\" \"actions\" \"that\"\n     [,65] [,66] [,67]    [,68]     [,69] [,70] [,71]    [,72]       [,73]\n[1,] \"may\" \"be\"  \"chosen\" \"instead\" \"of\"  \"the\" \"action\" \"described\" \"in\" \n     [,74] [,75]  [,76]     [,77]  [,78]   [,79]         [,80]     [,81]  [,82]\n[1,] \"the\" \"EIS.\" \"Several\" \"U.S.\" \"state\" \"governments\" \"require\" \"that\" \"a\"  \n     [,83]      [,84]     [,85] [,86] [,87] [,88] [,89]       [,90] [,91]\n[1,] \"document\" \"similar\" \"to\"  \"an\"  \"EIS\" \"be\"  \"submitted\" \"to\"  \"the\"\n     [,92]   [,93] [,94]     [,95]      [,96] [,97]      [,98] [,99]        \n[1,] \"state\" \"for\" \"certain\" \"actions.\" \"For\" \"example,\" \"in\"  \"California,\"\n     [,100] [,101]          [,102]   [,103]   [,104]  [,105] [,106] [,107]     \n[1,] \"an\"   \"Environmental\" \"Impact\" \"Report\" \"(EIR)\" \"must\" \"be\"   \"submitted\"\n     [,108] [,109] [,110]  [,111] [,112]    [,113]     [,114] [,115]     \n[1,] \"to\"   \"the\"  \"state\" \"for\"  \"certain\" \"actions,\" \"as\"   \"described\"\n     [,116] [,117] [,118]       [,119]          [,120]    [,121] [,122]   \n[1,] \"in\"   \"the\"  \"California\" \"Environmental\" \"Quality\" \"Act\"  \"(CEQA).\"\n     [,123] [,124] [,125] [,126]    [,127]    [,128] [,129] [,130] [,131]\n[1,] \"One\"  \"of\"   \"the\"  \"primary\" \"authors\" \"of\"   \"the\"  \"act\"  \"is\"  \n     [,132]   [,133] [,134]     \n[1,] \"Lynton\" \"K.\"   \"Caldwell.\"\n\n\nwhich shows 134 words in the text.\nI need to point out that I added the simplify=TRUE option to str_split. Had I not done that, it would have returned a list object that contained the individual vector of words. There are various reasons that it returns a list, none of which I can frankly understand, that is just the way the authors of the function made it.\n\n\nSubstrings\nThere are two different things you may want to do with substrings; find them and replace them. Here are some ways to figure out where they are.\n\nstr_detect(corpus, \"Environment\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nstr_count( corpus, \"Environment\")\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\nstr_locate_all( corpus, \"Environment\")\n\n[[1]]\n     start end\n[1,]   125 135\n[2,]   637 647\n[3,]   754 764\n\n\nWe can also replace instances of one substring with another.\n\nstr_replace_all(corpus, \"California\", \"Virginia\")\n\n[1] \"An environmental impact statement (EIS), under United States environmental law, is a document required by the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for certain actions 'significantly affecting the quality of the human environment'.[1] An EIS is a tool for decision making.

    "text": "Dates\n\nTime is the next dimension.\n\nThis topic covers the basics of how we put together data based upone date and time objects. For this, we will use the following data frame with a single column of data representing dates as they are written in the US.\nThese are several challenges associated with working with date and time objects. To those of us who are reading this with a background of how US time and date formats are read, we can easily interpret data objects as Month/Day/Year formats (e.g., “2/14/2018”), and is commonly represented in the kind of input data we work in R with as with a string of characters. Dates and times are sticky things in data analysis because they do not work the way we think they should. Here are some wrinkles:\n\nThere are many types of calendars, we use the Julian calendar. However, there are many other calendars that are in use that we may run into. Each of these calendars has a different starting year (e.g., in the Assyrian calendar it is year 6770, it is 4718 in the Chinese calendar, 2020 in the Gregorian, and 1442 in the Islamic calendar).\nWestern calendar has leap years (+1 day in February) as well as leap seconds because it is based on the rotation around the sun, others are based upon the lunar cycle and have other corrections.\nOn this planet, we have 24 different time zones. Some states (looking at you Arizona) don’t feel it necessary to follow the other states around so they may be the same as PST some of the year and the same as MST the rest of the year. The provence of Newfoundland decided to be half-way between time zones so they are GMT-2:30. Some states have more than one time zone even if they are not large in size (hello Indiana).\nDates and time are made up of odd units, 60-seconds a minute, 60-minutes an hour, 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, 2-weeks a fortnight, 28,29,30,or 31-days in a month, 365 or 366 days in a year, 100 years in a century, etc.\n\nFortunately, some smart programmers have figured this out for us already. What they did is made the second as the base unit of time and designated 00:00:00 on 1 January 1970 as the unix epoch. Time on most modern computers is measured from that starting point. It is much easier to measure the difference between two points in time using the seconds since unix epich and then translate it into one or more of these calendars than to deal with all the different calendars each time. So under the hood, much of the date and time issues are kept in terms of epoch seconds.\n\nunclass( Sys.time() )\n\n[1] 1737047051\n\n\n\nBasic Date Objects\nR has some basic date functionality built into it. One of the easiest says to get a date object created is to specify the a date as a character string and then coerce it into a data object. By default, this requires us to represent the date objects as “YEAR-MONTH-DAY” with padding 0 values for any integer of month or date below 9 (e.g., must be two-digits).\nSo for example, we can specify a date object as:\n\nclass_start &lt;- as.Date(\"2021-01-15\")\nclass_start\n\n[1] \"2021-01-15\"\n\n\nAnd it is of type:\n\nclass( class_start )\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nIf you want to make a the date from a different format, you need to specify what elements within the string representation using format codes. These codes (and many more) can be found by looking at ?strptime.\n\nclass_end &lt;- as.Date( \"5/10/21\", format = \"%m/%d/%y\")\nclass_end\n\n[1] \"2021-05-10\"\n\n\nI like to use some higher-level date functions from the lubridate library. If you don’t have it installed, do so using the normal approach.\n\nlibrary( lubridate )\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n\n\nDate objects can be put into vectors and sequences just like other objects.\n\nsemester &lt;- seq( class_start, class_end, by = \"1 day\")\nsemester\n\n  [1] \"2021-01-15\" \"2021-01-16\" \"2021-01-17\" \"2021-01-18\" \"2021-01-19\"\n  [6] \"2021-01-20\" \"2021-01-21\" \"2021-01-22\" \"2021-01-23\" \"2021-01-24\"\n [11] \"2021-01-25\" \"2021-01-26\" \"2021-01-27\" \"2021-01-28\" \"2021-01-29\"\n [16] \"2021-01-30\" \"2021-01-31\" \"2021-02-01\" \"2021-02-02\" \"2021-02-03\"\n [21] \"2021-02-04\" \"2021-02-05\" \"2021-02-06\" \"2021-02-07\" \"2021-02-08\"\n [26] \"2021-02-09\" \"2021-02-10\" \"2021-02-11\" \"2021-02-12\" \"2021-02-13\"\n [31] \"2021-02-14\" \"2021-02-15\" \"2021-02-16\" \"2021-02-17\" \"2021-02-18\"\n [36] \"2021-02-19\" \"2021-02-20\" \"2021-02-21\" \"2021-02-22\" \"2021-02-23\"\n [41] \"2021-02-24\" \"2021-02-25\" \"2021-02-26\" \"2021-02-27\" \"2021-02-28\"\n [46] \"2021-03-01\" \"2021-03-02\" \"2021-03-03\" \"2021-03-04\" \"2021-03-05\"\n [51] \"2021-03-06\" \"2021-03-07\" \"2021-03-08\" \"2021-03-09\" \"2021-03-10\"\n [56] \"2021-03-11\" \"2021-03-12\" \"2021-03-13\" \"2021-03-14\" \"2021-03-15\"\n [61] \"2021-03-16\" \"2021-03-17\" \"2021-03-18\" \"2021-03-19\" \"2021-03-20\"\n [66] \"2021-03-21\" \"2021-03-22\" \"2021-03-23\" \"2021-03-24\" \"2021-03-25\"\n [71] \"2021-03-26\" \"2021-03-27\" \"2021-03-28\" \"2021-03-29\" \"2021-03-30\"\n [76] \"2021-03-31\" \"2021-04-01\" \"2021-04-02\" \"2021-04-03\" \"2021-04-04\"\n [81] \"2021-04-05\" \"2021-04-06\" \"2021-04-07\" \"2021-04-08\" \"2021-04-09\"\n [86] \"2021-04-10\" \"2021-04-11\" \"2021-04-12\" \"2021-04-13\" \"2021-04-14\"\n [91] \"2021-04-15\" \"2021-04-16\" \"2021-04-17\" \"2021-04-18\" \"2021-04-19\"\n [96] \"2021-04-20\" \"2021-04-21\" \"2021-04-22\" \"2021-04-23\" \"2021-04-24\"\n[101] \"2021-04-25\" \"2021-04-26\" \"2021-04-27\" \"2021-04-28\" \"2021-04-29\"\n[106] \"2021-04-30\" \"2021-05-01\" \"2021-05-02\" \"2021-05-03\" \"2021-05-04\"\n[111] \"2021-05-05\" \"2021-05-06\" \"2021-05-07\" \"2021-05-08\" \"2021-05-09\"\n[116] \"2021-05-10\"\n\n\nSome helpful functions include the Julian Ordinal Day (e.g., number of days since the start of the year).\n\nordinal_day &lt;- yday( semester[102] )\nordinal_day\n\n[1] 116\n\n\nThe weekday as an integer (0-6 starting on Sunday), which I use to index the named values.\n\ndays_of_week &lt;- c(\"Sunday\",\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\",\"Wednesday\",\"Thursday\",\"Friday\",\"Saturday\")\nx &lt;- wday( semester[32] )\ndays_of_week[ x ]\n\n[1] \"Monday\"\n\n\nSince we did not specify a time, things like hour() and minute() do not provide any usable information.\n\n\nDates & Times\nTo add time to the date objects, we need to specify both date and time specifically. Here are some example data:\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame( Date = c(\"8/21/2004 7:33:51 AM\",\n                           \"7/12/2008 9:23:08 PM\",\n                           \"2/14/2010 8:18:30 AM\",\n                           \"12/23/2018 11:11:45 PM\",\n                           \"2/1/2019 4:42:00 PM\",\n                           \"5/17/2012 1:23:23 AM\",\n                           \"12/11/2020 9:48:02 PM\") )\nsummary( df )\n\n     Date          \n Length:7          \n Class :character  \n Mode  :character  \n\n\nJust like above, if we want to turn these into date and time objects we must be able to tell the parsing algorithm what elements are represented in each entry. There are many ways to make dates and time, 10/14 or 14 Oct or October 14 or Julian day 287, etc. These are designated by a format string were we indicate what element represents a day or month or year or hour or minute or second, etc. These are found by looking at the documentation for?strptime.\nIn our case, we have:\n- Month as 1 or 2 digits\n- Day as 1 or 2 digits\n- Year as 4 digits\n- a space to separate date from time\n- hour (not 24-hour though)\n- minutes in 2 digits\n- seconds in 2 digits\n- a space to separate time from timezone\n- timezone\n- / separating date objects\n- : separating time objects\nTo make the format string, we need to look up how to encode these items. The items in df for a date & time object such as 2/1/2019 4:42:00 PM have the format string:\n\nformat &lt;- \"%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p\"\n\nNow, we can convert the character string in the data frame to a date and time object.\n\n\nLubridate\nInstead of using the built-in as.Date() functionality, I like the lubridate library1 as it has a lot of additional functionality that we’ll play with a bit later.\n\ndf$Date &lt;- parse_date_time( df$Date, \n                            orders=format, \n                            tz = \"EST\" )\nsummary( df )\n\n      Date                       \n Min.   :2004-08-21 07:33:51.00  \n 1st Qu.:2009-04-29 14:50:49.00  \n Median :2012-05-17 01:23:23.00  \n Mean   :2013-07-11 07:28:39.85  \n 3rd Qu.:2019-01-12 19:56:52.50  \n Max.   :2020-12-11 21:48:02.00  \n\nclass( df$Date )\n\n[1] \"POSIXct\" \"POSIXt\" \n\n\nNow, we can ask Date-like questions about the data such as what day of the week was the first sample taken?\n\nweekdays( df$Date[1] )\n\n[1] \"Saturday\"\n\n\nWhat is the range of dates?\n\nrange( df$Date )\n\n[1] \"2004-08-21 07:33:51 EST\" \"2020-12-11 21:48:02 EST\"\n\n\nWhat is the median of samples\n\nmedian( df$Date )\n\n[1] \"2012-05-17 01:23:23 EST\"\n\n\nand what julian ordinal day (e.g., how many days since start of the year) is the last record.\n\nyday( df$Date[4] )\n\n[1] 357\n\n\nJust for fun, I’ll add a column to the data that has weekday.\n\ndf$Weekday &lt;- weekdays( df$Date )\ndf\n\n                 Date  Weekday\n1 2004-08-21 07:33:51 Saturday\n2 2008-07-12 21:23:08 Saturday\n3 2010-02-14 08:18:30   Sunday\n4 2018-12-23 23:11:45   Sunday\n5 2019-02-01 16:42:00   Friday\n6 2012-05-17 01:23:23 Thursday\n7 2020-12-11 21:48:02   Friday\n\n\nHowever, we should probably turn it into a factor (e.g., a data type with pre-defined levels—and for us here—an intrinsic order of the levels).\n\ndf$Weekday &lt;- factor( df$Weekday, \n                        ordered = TRUE, \n                        levels = days_of_week\n                        )\nsummary( df$Weekday )\n\n   Sunday    Monday   Tuesday Wednesday  Thursday    Friday  Saturday \n        2         0         0         0         1         2         2 \n\n\n\n\nFiltering on Date Objects\nWe can easily filter the content within a data.frame using some helper functions such as hour(), minute(), weekday(), etc. Here are some examples including pulling out the weekends.\n\nweekends &lt;- df[ df$Weekday %in% c(\"Saturday\",\"Sunday\"), ]\nweekends\n\n                 Date  Weekday\n1 2004-08-21 07:33:51 Saturday\n2 2008-07-12 21:23:08 Saturday\n3 2010-02-14 08:18:30   Sunday\n4 2018-12-23 23:11:45   Sunday\n\n\nfinding items that are in the past (paste being defined as the last time this document was knit).\n\npast &lt;- df$Date[ df$Date &lt; Sys.time() ]\npast\n\n[1] \"2004-08-21 07:33:51 EST\" \"2008-07-12 21:23:08 EST\"\n[3] \"2010-02-14 08:18:30 EST\" \"2018-12-23 23:11:45 EST\"\n[5] \"2019-02-01 16:42:00 EST\" \"2012-05-17 01:23:23 EST\"\n[7] \"2020-12-11 21:48:02 EST\"\n\n\nItems that are during working hours\n\nwork &lt;- df$Date[ hour(df$Date) &gt;= 9 & hour(df$Date) &lt;= 17 ]\nwork\n\n[1] \"2019-02-01 16:42:00 EST\"\n\n\nAnd total range of values in days using normal arithmatic operations such as the minus operator.\n\nmax(df$Date) - min(df$Date)\n\nTime difference of 5956.593 days"

    "text": "Counting, or ‘Non-Parametric’ Statistics\nTo date, we’ve been talking about the kinds of statistical approaches we use based upon the kind of data that we have for predictors and responses. Keeping it really simple, the graphic below attempts to capture this dynamic.\nIn this display, counting statistics are those that have factor data for both predictors and responses. However, the methods that we use in this quadrant, like \\(\\chi^2\\) tests, are a small fraction of available methods that we can classify as NonParametric statistics.\nNon-parametric counting statistics are essential tools in data analysis because they provide robust methods for understanding data without making strong assumptions about the underlying distribution. Many traditional statistical methods rely on parametric assumptions, such as normality, homoscedasticity, or linearity. However, real-world data often violate these assumptions due to skewness, outliers, or categorical variables. Non-parametric methods excel in these scenarios by leveraging the rank or order of data rather than its precise values, making them ideal for analyzing ordinal data, small sample sizes, or data sets with unknown distributions.\nCounting statistics, like chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact test, or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, allow researchers to test hypotheses about relationships or differences without assuming normality. For example, in environmental studies or survey analysis, datasets may include counts of species occurrences, categorical survey responses, or presence/absence data. Non-parametric methods ensure reliable results in these cases, enabling data-driven decisions even with non-normal or heterogeneous data that extend beyond just the lower right quadrant of the image above.\nSo let’s start simple and I’ll walk through a set of these kinds of models and highlight how we can apply a non-parametric approach to data whose identity may suggest other parametric statistics would be appropriate but whose normality or properties suggest that we not use those more traditional methods."

    "text": "The Binomial Test\nWe’ve discussed the Binomial as part of the underlying generative functions for Bayesian Statistics already, but let’s revisit it for just a moment to get more specific on its general status. As a reminder, this is a test where the outcomes can be classified into either “Group A” or “Group B” (a 2-level factor in R).\n\nAssumptions\nThe binomial test assumes:\n\nThe \\(n\\) samples are mutually independent.\n\nEach sample has an underlying probability, \\(p\\), of being classified in “Group A” and a probability of \\(1-p\\) of being assigned to “Group B”.\n\nThe test statistic for this analysis is the number of values observed in “Group A” as a count. Because we are testing for the value of \\(p\\) (or our confidence in the range of values it can assume), the null hypothesis is:\n\\(H_O: p = \\hat{p}\\)\nIn R, we can test this using the binom.test() function, whose signature is:\n\nYou can either give the function a single values for x and n or you can have x be a 2-element vector and skip the n part.\nBorrowing from a previous example, let’s assume we are sampling fish in the James River. The hypothesis is that the frequency of catfish is\n\\[\np_{catfish} = \\frac{N_{catfish}}{N_{catfish} + N_{other}} = \\frac{37}{50} \\approx 0.74\n\\]\nSo, if we were to go out and do some more sampling, the null hypotehsis would be:\n\\(H_O: p_{catfish} = 0.74\\)\nLet’s assume you just got back from a great sampling day and found the following data.\n\ncatfish &lt;- 52\nnon_catfish &lt;- 47 \n\nTo test if this sampling exercise is consistent with the previous assumption of a 74% catfish presence, we do:\n\nsamples &lt;- c( catfish, non_catfish )\np_catfish &lt;- 0.74\n\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame( Counts = c( samples, 0.74 * sum(samples), ( (1-0.74) * sum(samples) )),\n                    Fish = c(\"Catfish\", \"Other\", \"Catfish\", \"Other\"),\n                    Group = c(\"Observed\",\"Observed\", \"Expected\", \"Expected\") )\n\nggplot( df, \n        aes(Fish,Counts, fill=Group) )+ \n  geom_bar( position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfit &lt;- binom.test(x=samples, p = p_catfish )\nfit \n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  samples\nnumber of successes = 52, number of trials = 99, p-value = 5.007e-06\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.74\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4223973 0.6265570\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.5252525 \n\n\nWhose results suggest that \\(p_{catfish} \\ne 0.74\\) and we reject the null hypothesis. Our data subbest, from the samples we provided, that the observed \\(p_{catfish}\\) falls within the interval of 0.422 - 0.627.\nFor examples with more than two “Group”s, there is a multinomial test as well, but the function is not one built into R and you’ll want to check out the Multinomial package for that function."

Often it is taken as a comparison between populations. So, in keeping with our fish theme, let’s assume we went to another river and did another sampling run on catfish. In general, we are not limited to “Group A” vs “Group B” but we will use it for continuity here.\nOur sampling can be categorized as follows for the two populations of samples we’ve collected.\n\nThe values above are Observerd counts of observations in each pair of categories. Every fish is talled into the grouping (catfish vs not) and the location it was sampled (population 1 vs population 2). The total number of sampels at each population is \\(n_1\\) (in the data it was $n_1 =$99) and \\(n_2\\) (to be shown below) and the total number of samples that are catfish is \\(C_1 = O_{11} + O_{21}\\) and not catfish as \\(C_2\\) which also happens to be \\(N - C_1\\) (for completeness).\nAgain, here we have 2 rows and 2 columns, but this can be extended to larger numbers of groupings and sampling population as necessary and the analysis is the same.\nIn this simple case, the null hypothesis is not about the exact value of \\(p_{catfish}\\), as in the binomial, but rather that the frequency of catfish in Population 1, let’s define this as \\(p_1\\) is equal to the probabilty of sampling a catfish at Population 2, which we define as \\(p_2\\).\n\\(H_O: p_1 = p_2\\)"

Let’s say I went out to another site and did 50 more samples and found 32 catfish.\nHere is a matrix with these numbers. I’m going to decorate it with row and column labels for clarity.\n\nObserved &lt;- matrix( c(52, 47, 32, 18), nrow=2, byrow = TRUE)\nrownames( Observed ) &lt;- c(\"Population 1\", \"Population 2\")\ncolnames( Observed ) &lt;- c(\"Catfish\", \"Other\")\nObserved\n\n             Catfish Other\nPopulation 1      52    47\nPopulation 2      32    18\n\n\nOur expectations are based on the \\(p_{catfish} = 0.74\\) and can be used to create an Expected value for each of the cells in the matrix above. For example, the expected value for the number of catfish from Population 1 would be \\(n_1 * 0.74\\) and for non-catfish would be \\((1-0.74) * n_1\\). We can do the same for the second site.\n\nn1 &lt;- 52 + 47\nn2 &lt;- 32 + 18 \n\nExpected &lt;- matrix( c( 0.74 * n1, \n                       (1-0.74) * n1, \n                       0.74 * n2,\n                       (1-0.74) * n2), nrow=2, byrow = TRUE)\nrownames( Expected ) &lt;- c(\"Population 1\", \"Population 2\")\ncolnames( Expected ) &lt;- c(\"Catfish\", \"Other\")\nExpected\n\n             Catfish Other\nPopulation 1   73.26 25.74\nPopulation 2   37.00 13.00\n\n\nSo, in some sense, we set the underlying probability of catfish in either locale to \\(0.74\\). If the observed values are close to the expected, then the data would be consistent with what is expected from the underlying hypothesis. If they are not close, then the data data are deviating. The amount of deviation is what we will be using as a test statistic here and it is a measure of:\n\nHow far apart \\(O_{xy}\\) is from \\(E_{xy}\\),\nStandardized by the magnitude of the \\(E_{xy}\\).\n\nGiving us the test statistic:\n\\[\nT = \\sum_{i=1}^r\\sum_{j=1}^c\\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}\n\\]\nThe subscripts account for the number of rows (\\(r\\)) and columns (\\(c\\)) for any arbitrary sized table beyond the 2x2 example we have here. We can estimate the test statistic in R direclty, as:\n\nT &lt;- sum(  (Observed - Expected)^2 / Expected )\nT\n\n[1] 26.32813\n\n\nThis test statistic is expected to be equivalent to a \\(\\Chi^2\\) statistic with \\((r-1)(c-1)\\) degrees of freedom.

So, the test statistic is $T =$26.3281253 and the critical value is 3.8414588, so we would Reject H_O that the fraction of catfish/not-catfish from Population 1 is not the same as observed in Population 2.\nBut, we are still stuck with the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) issue and we’d probably rather have the actual p-value for the observed Test statistic, \\(T\\).\n\np.value &lt;- 1.0 - pchisq( T, df=1 )\np.value\n\n[1] 2.88063e-07\n\n\nNotice I’ve used the qschisq function to get hte critcal value for some probability and the pchisq to the probability associated with an observed value. Every distribution has p* and q* functions associated with them and can be used to find critical values and probabilities if you need to do it manually.\nIn the real world, you’ll probably be taking the data from a larger data.frame object where you collected additional data.

The longest running recommendation comes form Cochran1, who suggested that any time you have an \\(E_{ij} \\le 1\\) or if more than 20% of the \\(E_{ij} \\le 5\\), there may be some issues with statistical power and the approximation for the \\(\\Chi^2\\) statistic may be poor. In those cases, perhaps a permutation approach would be more appropriate."

As we saw before, there is an option in the normal cor.test function that allows you to use a rank-based analysis instead of the normal Pearson Product-Moment approach.\n\nThis approach, basically, orders the magnitude of both predictor and response and assigns a rank (e.g., \\(1^{st}, 2^{nd}, \\ldots N^{th}\\)) for both variables and then estimates the relationship by correlating the ranked values instead of the raw values.\nFor brevity, I’ll not give an example and have you look back at the correlation lecture for more information."

    "text": "Other Regression Approaches\nThere are several additional approaches including Kernel Regression (e.g., Nadaraya & Watson’s Kernel Smoother) and Local Averaging (e.g., Friedman’s Super Smoother). If you need to perform a regression approach, please explore the benefits and challenges with these alternative methods before deciding on which one to use.\n\nMann-Whitney Test For the Equivallence of Two Means\nSo, this is an extension of the t-test for the equivalence of the mean values of two data sets (e.g., \\(H_O: \\bar{x} = \\bar{y}\\)). This assume that two sets of data are independently sampled and tests for the equality of the samples based upon ranks of the data in each set.\n\nAssumptions\nThis approach has the following assumptions:\n\nBoth sets of data are random samples from their respective population.\n\nEach of the populations are similarly independent.\nThe measurement scale for each variable is at least ordinal (e.g., you can put them in order).\n\nFor this test, I’m just going to use the Motor Trends car data we’ve seen before and look at the mileage of cars that have a manual vs an automatic transmission. Here is the distribution of the data in a density plot.\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  select( Transmission = am, MPG = mpg ) |&gt;\n  mutate( Transmission = as.factor( Transmission ) ) |&gt;\n  mutate( Transmission = fct_recode( Transmission, \"Automatic\"=\"0\", \"Manual\"=\"1\")) -&gt; data\n\ndata |&gt;\n  ggplot( aes(Transmission, MPG) )  + \n  geom_boxplot( notch=TRUE )\n\nNotch went outside hinges\nℹ Do you want `notch = FALSE`?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo test this, we use the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.

This is a non-negative numerical value.\nIBU - The ‘International Bitterness Unit’ which roughly measures the amont of \\(\\alpha\\)-acids (asymptotically) added to the beer by the hops. This is a non-negative numerical value, with higher values indicating more bitter beer, though human ability to taste increasingly bitter beer is asymptotic.\nSRM - The Standard Reference Method calibration measuring the color of the finished beer. This is a non-negative integer going from 1 - 40 (light straw color - dark opaque).\nOG - The amount of dissolved sugars in the wort (the pre-beer liquid prior to putting in yeast and the initiation of fermentation), relative to pure water. This is a measurement ‘relative’ to water, which is 1.0. Values less than 1.0 have lower liquid densities than pure water and those greater than 1.0 have more dissolved sugars than pure water.\nFG - The amount of dissolved sugars in the beer after fermentation has been completed. Same as above but the difference in OG and FG can tell us what the ABV should be. Hihger FG beers are more sweet and have more body than lower OG beers (which may appear to have a cleaner, drier, mouth feel—yes that is a real term as well).\n\nAs we talk about correlations, we will use these as examples."

This distribution is denoted as \\(N(\\mu,\\sigma)\\) and the differences in the mean value (\\(\\mu\\)) and the variation measured by the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) are shown below for \\(N(0,1)\\), \\(N(0,5)\\), and \\(N(10,1)\\).\n\nN &lt;- 1000\ndata.frame( Distribution = rep(c(\"N(0,1)\",\"N(10,1)\", \"N(0,5)\"), each=N ),\n            Data = c( rnorm(N,0,1),\n                      rnorm(N,10,1),\n                      rnorm(N,0,5) ) ) %&gt;%\n  ggplot( aes( Data ) ) + \n  geom_histogram( alpha=0.75, \n                  bins = 50) + \n  facet_grid(Distribution ~.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of ways to look at our data to see if they can be considered as normal. First, visually we can plot the theoretical (parameter) quantiles of the data against the sample quantiles using the qqnorm() plot. What this does is sort the data by expectation and observation and plot them and if the data are normal, then they should roughly be in a straight line. The qqline() function shows the expected line (n.b., this is another one of those things where you have to run the whole chunk to get both points and lines on the same graph if you are working in Markdown).\n\nqqnorm( beer$ABV_Min )\nqqline( beer$ABV_Min, col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what we commonly see is most of the data falling along the line throughout the middle portion of the distribution and then deviating around the edges. What this does not do is give you a statistic to test to see if we can reject the hypothesis \\(H_O: Data\\;is\\;normal\\). For this, we can use the Shapiro-Wilkes Normality test which produces the statistic:\n[ W = ]\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of samples, \\(a_i\\) is a standardizing coeeficient, \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) value of \\(x\\), \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean of the observed values, and \\(R_{x_i}\\) is the rank of the \\(x_i^{th}\\) observation.\n\nshapiro.test( beer$ABV_Min )\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  beer$ABV_Min\nW = 0.94595, p-value = 0.0004532\n\n\nRejection of the null hypothesis (e.g., a small p-value from the test) indicates that the data are not to be considered as coming from a normal distribution. So, for the ABV_Min data above, it appears that it is not actually normally distributed. So what do we do?\n\n\nTransformations\nIf the data are not normal, we can look towards trying to see if we can transform it to a normally distributed variable. There are a lot of\nStudentized Data - One way to standardize the data is to make it have a mean of 0.0 and a standard deviation of 1.0. To do this, we subtract the mean() and divide by the sd().\n\nx &lt;- beer$ABV_Min \nx.std &lt;- (x - mean(x)) / sd( x )\n\nThere are times when this can be a nice way to compare the\nBox Cox - In 1964, Box & Cox defined a family of transformations known as the Box/Cox. This family is defined by a single parameter, \\(\\lambda\\), whose value may vary depending upon the data. The original data, \\(x\\), is then transformed using the following relationship\n[ = ]\nAs long as \\(\\lambda \\ne 0\\) (else we would be dividing by zero, which is not a good thing)!\nOne way to use this transformation is to look at a range of values for \\(\\lambda\\) and determine if the transformation\n\ntest_boxcox &lt;- function( x, lambdas = seq(-1.1, 1.1, by = 0.015) ) {\n  ret &lt;- data.frame( Lambda = lambdas,\n                     W = NA,\n                     P = NA)\n  \n  for( lambda in lambdas ) {\n    x.tilde &lt;- (x^lambda - 1) / lambda   \n    w &lt;- shapiro.test( x.tilde )\n    ret$W[ ret$Lambda == lambda ] &lt;- w$statistic\n    ret$P[ ret$Lambda == lambda ] &lt;- w$p.value\n  }\n  \n  return( ret )\n}\n\nvals &lt;- test_boxcox( beer$ABV_Min ) \n\n\nvals %&gt;%\n  ggplot( aes(Lambda, P) ) + \n  geom_line() + \n  ylab(\"P-Value\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if you look at this plot, it shows the P-value of the Shapiro-Wilkes test across a range of values. Depending upon the level of rigor, this approaches the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) value closest at:\n\nvals[ which(vals$P == max( vals$P)),]\n\n   Lambda        W          P\n82  0.115 0.973805 0.04351988\n\n\nwith \\(\\lambda = 0.115\\) and a \\(P = 0.044\\).\nArc-Sine Square Root When dealing with fractions, it is common that they do not behave very well when they are very close to 0.0 or 1.0. One of the common transformations to use with these kinds of data is the arc-sin square root transformation. For us, the ABV columns in the data is a percentage (but listed in numerical form as percent not as fraction). So to transform it we can do the following.\n\nabv &lt;- beer$ABV_Min / 100.0\nasin( sqrt( abv ) ) -&gt; abv.1\nshapiro.test( abv.1)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  abv.1\nW = 0.96746, p-value = 0.01418"

Most non-parametric tests are based upon ranks of the data rather than the assumption of normality of the data that is necessary for the Pearson Product Moment statistic. One of the constraints for non-parametric statistics is that they are often evaluated for probability based upon permutations.\nThe form of the estimator for this is almost identical to that of the Pearson statistic except that instead of the raw data, we are replacing values with the ranks of each value instead. In doing so, there is a loss of the breadth of the raw data since we are just using ranks, and if the underlying data are poorly behaved because of outliers or other issues, this takes care of it.\n[ _{Spearman} = ]\nWith the same data, it does provide potentially different estimates of the amount of correlation between the variables.\n\nOG.FG.spearman &lt;- cor.test( beer$OG_Max, beer$FG_Max, \n                            method = \"spearman\" )\n\nWarning in cor.test.default(beer$OG_Max, beer$FG_Max, method = \"spearman\"):\nCannot compute exact p-value with ties\n\nOG.FG.spearman\n\n\n    Spearman's rank correlation rho\n\ndata:  beer$OG_Max and beer$FG_Max\nS = 39257, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\n      rho \n0.7644328"

    "section": "Permutation Testing for Significance",
    "text": "Permutation Testing for Significance\nIn both of the previous methods, we used specific approaches to evaluate the significance of the statistic. For Pearson, we approximated using the \\(t\\). For the Spearman test with small numbers of samples, an approximation of the \\(t\\) test is used, based upon counting ranks and the number of ways we can get different combinations of ranks. For larger sample size tests using Spearman, an approximation using the \\(t\\) test can be used.\nAnother way of doing this is based upon permutation and this approach can be applied to a wide array of questions. For correlation’s, if we consider the null hypothesis \\(H_O: \\rho = 0\\) we can make a few inferences. If this hypothesis is true then we are, essentially, saying that the current relationship between \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) has no intrinsic relationship as there is no correlation. This is, by default, what the null hypothesis says.\nIf that is true, however, that means that any permutation of one of the variables, say \\(y\\), should produce a correlation statistic that is just as large as any other permutation of the data. This is key.\nSo, if we assume the \\(H_O\\) is true then we should be able to shuffle one of the data and estimate a correlation statistic a large number of times. We can then create a permuted distribution of values for the correlation, Assuming the NULL Hypothesis is true. To this distribution, we can evaluate the magnitude of the original correlation. Here is an example using the data from above.\n\nx &lt;- beer$OG_Max\ny &lt;- beer$FG_Max\ndf &lt;- data.frame( Estimate = factor( c( \"Original\",\n                                        rep(\"Permuted\", 999))), \n                  rho =  c( cor.test( x, y )$estimate,\n                            rep(NA, 999)) )\n\nsummary( df )\n\n     Estimate        rho        \n Original:  1   Min.   :0.8374  \n Permuted:999   1st Qu.:0.8374  \n                Median :0.8374  \n                Mean   :0.8374  \n                3rd Qu.:0.8374  \n                Max.   :0.8374  \n                NA's   :999     \n\n\nNow, we can go through the 999 NA values we put into that data frame and:\n1. Permute one of the variables 2. Run the analysis\n3. Store the statistic.\n\nfor( i in 2:1000) {\n  yhat &lt;- sample( y,   # this shuffles the data in y\n                  size = length(y), \n                  replace = FALSE)\n  model &lt;- cor.test( x, yhat )\n  df$rho[i] &lt;- model$estimate \n}\n\nNow we can look at the distribution of permuted values and the original one and see the relationship. If:\n\nThe observed value is within the body of the permuted values, then it is not too rare—given \\(H_O\\), or\nIf the observed value is way outside those permuted values, then it appears to be somewhat rare.\n\n\nggplot( df ) + \n  geom_histogram( aes(rho, fill=Estimate ) )\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look at the graph above, you see that the original value is way bigger than the values that would be found if and only if \\(H_O\\) were true. This suggests that the correlation is not zero and in fact it is the largest observation of the 1000 observations (a P estimate of \\(\\frac{1}{1000}\\)…)."

There is this cool function everthying() that helps out.\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  select( RecordID, ODO_mgl, PH, everything() ) -&gt; df\nnames( df )\n\n [1] \"RecordID\"                       \"ODO_mgl\"                       \n [3] \"PH\"                             \"DateTime\"                      \n [5] \"PAR\"                            \"WindSpeed_mph\"                 \n [7] \"WindDir\"                        \"AirTempF\"                      \n [9] \"RelHumidity\"                    \"BP_HG\"                         \n[11] \"Rain_in\"                        \"H2O_TempC\"                     \n[13] \"SpCond_mScm\"                    \"Salinity_ppt\"                  \n[15] \"PH_mv\"                          \"Turbidity_ntu\"                 \n[17] \"Chla_ugl\"                       \"BGAPC_CML\"                     \n[19] \"BGAPC_rfu\"                      \"ODO_sat\"                       \n[21] \"Depth_ft\"                       \"Depth_m\"                       \n[23] \"SurfaceWaterElev_m_levelNad83m\"\n\n\n\n\nFilter\nThe function filter() works to select records (rows) based upon some criteria. So for example, if I am interested in just records when the airtemp was freezing (and the raw data are in °F). The range of values in the original data was:\n\nrange( rice$AirTempF )\n\n[1]  3.749 74.870\n\n\nbut after filtering using the name of the variable and a logical operator.\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  filter( AirTempF &lt; 32 ) -&gt; df\nrange( df$AirTempF )\n\n[1]  3.749 31.990\n\n\nJust like select(), it is possible to have several conditions, that are compounded (using a logical AND operator) by adding them to the filter() function. Here I also split the conditionals requiring the data to be above freezing air temperatures, not missing data from the PH meter, and water turbidity &lt; 15 ntu’s. I also put each of these onto their own lines and auto-indent does a great job of making it reasonably readable.\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  filter( AirTempF &gt; 32, \n          !is.na(PH), \n          Turbidity_ntu &lt; 15) -&gt; df\nnrow(df)\n\n[1] 1449\n\n\n\n\nMutate\nThe mutate() function changes values in the table and is quite versatile. Here I will jump back to our old friend mdy_hms() from lubridate and convert the DateTime column, which is\n\nclass( rice$DateTime )\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nand convert it into a real date and time object\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  mutate( Date = mdy_hms(DateTime, tz = \"EST\") ) -&gt; df\nclass( df$Date )\n\n[1] \"POSIXct\" \"POSIXt\" \n\nsummary( df$Date )\n\n                 Min.               1st Qu.                Median \n\"2014-01-01 00:00:00\" \"2014-01-22 08:22:30\" \"2014-02-12 16:45:00\" \n                 Mean               3rd Qu.                  Max. \n\"2014-02-12 16:45:00\" \"2014-03-06 01:07:30\" \"2014-03-27 09:30:00\" \n\n\nYou can also create several mutations in one mutation step.\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  mutate( Date = mdy_hms(DateTime, tz = \"EST\"), \n          Month = month(Date, label = TRUE) ) -&gt; df\nsummary( df$Month )\n\n Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec \n2976 2688 2535    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0 \n\n\n\n\nArrange\nWe can sort entire data.frame objects based upon the values in one or more of the columns using the arrange() function.\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  arrange( WindSpeed_mph ) -&gt; df \ndf$WindSpeed_mph[1]\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nBy default, it is in ascending order, to reverse it, use the negative operator on the column name object in the function.\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  arrange( -WindSpeed_mph ) -&gt; df \ndf$WindSpeed_mph[1]\n\n[1] 30.65\n\n\nAs above, it is possible to combine many columns of data as criteria for sorting by adding more arguments to the function call.\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  arrange( -WindSpeed_mph, WindDir ) -&gt; df\n\n\n\nSummarise\nThis function is the first one that does not return some version of the original data that was passed to it. Rather, this performs operations on the data and makes a brand new data.frame object.\nEach argument you give to the function performs one or more operations on the data and returns a brand new data.frame object with only the the values specified.\nHere is an example where I am taking the mean air and water temperature (n.b., one is in °F and the other is in °C). Notice the result is a new data.frame object with one row and two new columns defined by how I asked for the summary in the first place. I used single tick notation so I can have a space in the column names.\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  summarize( `Air Temp` = mean( AirTempF), \n             `Water Temp` = mean(H2O_TempC, na.rm=TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  `Air Temp` `Water Temp`\n       &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       38.8         5.53\n\n\n\n\nGroup & Summarize\nTo get more than one row in the resulting data.frame from summary(), we need to group the data in some way. The function group_by() does this and is used prior to summary(). Let’s take a look at how we can get the average air and water temp by month. To do this, I’m going to have to do several steps. I’m just going to chain them together using the %&gt;% operator.\n\nrice %&gt;%\n  mutate( Date = mdy_hms( DateTime, \n                          tz=\"EST\"),\n          Month = month( Date, \n                         abbr = FALSE, \n                         label=TRUE) ) %&gt;%\n  group_by( Month ) %&gt;%\n  summarize( `Air Temp` = mean( AirTempF), \n             `Water Temp` = mean( H2O_TempC, \n                                  na.rm=TRUE) )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  Month    `Air Temp` `Water Temp`\n  &lt;ord&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 January        34.7         3.68\n2 February       39.7         5.29\n3 March          42.6         7.96\n\n\nAs you read the code, notice how easy it is to understand what is going on because of both the pipes and because of the way I am formatting the code itself."

I typically build up the workflow, one line at a time. Make sure the output from the previous line is what you think it should be then add the next one.\nKeep your code open and airy, it makes it easier to read and to catch any logical errors that may arrise.\nYou can pipe into a lot of different functions.

    "text": "Basic Plotting in R\nThe base R comes with several built-in plotting functions, each of which is accessed through a single function with a wide array of optional arguments that modify the overall appearance.\nHistograms - The Density of A Single Data Vector\n\nhist( iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the default values for the hist() function label the x-axis & title on the graph have the names of the variable passed to it, with a y-axis is set to “Frequency”.\n\nxlab & ylab: The names attached to both x- and y-axes.\nmain: The title on top of the graph.\nbreaks: This controls the way in which the original data are partitioned (e.g., the width of the bars along the x-axis).\n\nIf you pass a single number, n to this option, the data will be partitioned into n bins.\nIf you pass a sequence of values to this, it will use this sequence as the boundaries of bins.\n\ncol: The color of the bar (not the border)\nprobability: A flag as either TRUE or FALSE (the default) to have the y-axis scaled by total likelihood of each bins rather than a count of the numbrer of elements in that range.\n\nDensity - Estimating the continuous density of data\n\nd_sepal.length &lt;- density( iris$Sepal.Length )\nd_sepal.length\n\n\nCall:\n    density.default(x = iris$Sepal.Length)\n\nData: iris$Sepal.Length (150 obs.); Bandwidth 'bw' = 0.2736\n\n       x               y            \n Min.   :3.479   Min.   :0.0001495  \n 1st Qu.:4.790   1st Qu.:0.0341599  \n Median :6.100   Median :0.1534105  \n Mean   :6.100   Mean   :0.1905934  \n 3rd Qu.:7.410   3rd Qu.:0.3792237  \n Max.   :8.721   Max.   :0.3968365  \n\n\nThe density() function estimates a continuous probability density function for the data and returns an object that has both x and y values. In fact, it is a special kind of object.\n\nclass(d_sepal.length)\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\n\nBecause of this, the general plot() function knows how to plot these kinds of things.\n\nplot( d_sepal.length )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the general plot() function has A TON of options and is overloaded to be able to plot all kinds of data. In addition to xlab and ylab, we modify the following:\n\ncol: Color of the line.\nlwd: Line width\nbty: This covers the ‘box type’, which is the square box around the plot area. I typically use bty=\"n\" because I hate those square boxes around my plots (compare the following 2 plots to see the differences). But you do you.\nxlim & ylim: These dictate the range on both the x- and y-axes. It takes a pair of values such as c(min,max) and then limits (or extends) that axis to to fill that range.\n\nScatter Plots - Plotting two variables\n\nplot( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the most general plot(). The form of the arguments to this function are x-data and then y-data. The visual representation of the data is determined by the optional values you pass (or if you do not pass any optional values, the default is the scatter plot shown above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntype\nThe kind of plot to show (’p’oint, ’l’ine, ’b’oth, or ’o’ver). A point plot is the default.\n\n\npch\nThe character (or symbol) being used to plot. There 26 recognized general characters to use for plotting. The default is pch=1.\n\n\ncol\nThe color of the symbols/lines that are plot.\n\n\ncex\nThe magnification size of the character being plot. The default is cex=1 and deviation from that will increase (\\(cex &gt; 1\\)) or decrease (\\(0 &lt; cex &lt; 1\\)) the scaling of the symbols.\n\n\nlwd\nThe width of any lines in the plot.\n\n\nlty\nThe type of line to be plot (solid, dashed, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the relevant things you can use the parameter pch for is to differentiate between groups of observations (such as different species for example). Instead of giving it one value, pass it a vector of values whose length is equal to that for x- and y-axis data.\nHere is an example where I coerce the iris$Species data vector into numeric types and use that for symbols.\n\nsymbol &lt;- as.numeric(iris$Species)\nsymbol\n\n  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [38] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n [75] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n[112] 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n[149] 3 3\n\n\n\nplot( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, pch=symbol )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the same technique to use col instead of pch. Here I make a vector of color names and then use the previously defined in the variable symbol.\n\nraw_colors &lt;- c(\"red\",\"gold\",\"forestgreen\")\ncolors &lt;- raw_colors[ symbol ]\ncolors[1:10]\n\n [1] \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\"\n\n\nIn addition to the general form for the function plot(x,y) we used above, we can use an alternative designation based upon what is called the functional form. The functional form is how we designate functions in R, such as regression anlaysis. This basic syntax for this is y ~ x, that is the response variable (on the y-axis) is a function of the predictor (on the x-axis).\nFor simplicty, I’ll make x and y varibles pointing to the same same data as in the previous graph.\n\ny &lt;- iris$Sepal.Width\nx &lt;- iris$Sepal.Length\n\nThen, the plot() function can be written as (including all the fancy additional stuff we just described):\n\nplot( y ~ x , \n      col=colors, \n      pch=20, \n      bty=\"n\", \n      xlab=\"Sepal Length\", ylab=\"Sepal Width\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is much easier to read (also notice how I used serveral lines to put in all the options to the plot function for legibility).\nBar Plots - Quantifying Counts\nThe barplot function takes a set of heights, one for each bar. Let’s quickly grab the mean length for sepals across all three species. There are many ways to do this, here are two, the first being more pedantic and the second more concise.\nThe iris data is in a data.frame that has a column designating the species. We can see which ones using unique().\n\nunique( iris$Species )\n\n[1] setosa     versicolor virginica \nLevels: setosa versicolor virginica\n\n\nTo estimate the mean for each species, we can take values in iris$Sepal.Length for each level of iris$Species using indices.\n\nmu.Setosa &lt;- mean( iris$Sepal.Length[ iris$Species == \"setosa\" ])\nmu.Versicolor &lt;- mean( iris$Sepal.Length[ iris$Species == \"versicolor\" ])\nmu.Virginica &lt;- mean( iris$Sepal.Length[ iris$Species == \"virginica\" ])\n\nmeanSepalLength &lt;- c( mu.Setosa, mu.Versicolor, mu.Virginica )\nmeanSepalLength\n\n[1] 5.006 5.936 6.588\n\n\nWhen we plot these data using barplot() we pass the values and set the names of the bars us\n\nbarplot( meanSepalLength, \n         names.arg = c(\"setosa\",\"versicolor\",\"virginica\"), \n         xlab=\"Iris Species\",\n         ylab=\"Mean Sepal Length\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second way to do this is to use the by() function (see ?by for the complete help file). The by function takes the following objects:\n\nThe raw data to use as measurements. Here we will use iris$Sepal.Length as the raw data.\nData designating groups to partition the raw data into (we will use iris$Species).\nThe function that you want to use on each group. (here we will ask for the mean).\n\n\nmeanSepalLength &lt;- by( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean )\nmeanSepalLength\n\niris$Species: setosa\n[1] 5.006\n------------------------------------------------------------ \niris$Species: versicolor\n[1] 5.936\n------------------------------------------------------------ \niris$Species: virginica\n[1] 6.588\n\n\nThe data returned from this function is both numeric and has a name set for each value.\n\nis.numeric( meanSepalLength )\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nnames( meanSepalLength )\n\n[1] \"setosa\"     \"versicolor\" \"virginica\" \n\n\nThen when we pass that to barplot() the column labels are set automatically (e.g., no need to set names.arg as above).\n\nbarplot( meanSepalLength, \n         xlab = \"Iris Species\",\n         ylab = \"Average Sepal Length\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots - High density information\nA boxplot contains a high amount of information content and is appropriate when the groupings on the x-axis are categorical. For each category, the graphical representation includes:\n\nThe median value for the raw data\nA box indicating the area between the first and third quartile (e.g,. the values enclosing the 25% - 75% of the data). The top and bottoms are often referred to as the hinges of the box.\nA notch (if requested), represents confidence around the estimate of the median.\nWhiskers extending out to shows \\(\\pm 1.5 * IQR\\) (the Inner Quartile Range)\nAny points of the data that extend beyond the whiskers are plot as points.\n\nFor legibility, we can use the functional form for the plots as well as separate out the data.frame from the columns using the optional data= argument.\n\nboxplot( Sepal.Length ~ Species, \n         data = iris, \n         notch=TRUE, \n         ylab=\"Sepal Length\" )"

    "text": "Colors\nNamed Colors - There are 657 pre-defined, named colors built into the base R distribution. Here is a random selection of those values.\n\nrandomColors &lt;- sample( colors(), size = nrow(iris) )\nhead(randomColors)\n\n[1] \"gray79\"     \"palegreen2\" \"sienna3\"    \"gray56\"     \"peru\"      \n[6] \"grey64\"    \n\n\nTo use these colors, you can specify them by name for either all the elements\n\nboxplot( Sepal.Length ~ Species, \n         data = iris, \n         col = randomColors[1],\n         notch=TRUE, \n         ylab=\"Sepal Length\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor for each element individually.\n\nboxplot( Sepal.Length ~ Species, \n         data = iris, \n         col = randomColors[1:3],\n         notch=TRUE, \n         ylab=\"Sepal Length\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHex Colors: You can also use hexadecimal representations of colors, which is most commonly used on the internet. A hex representation of colors consists of red, green, and blue values encoded as numbers in base 16 (e.g., the single digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F). There are a lot of great resources on the internet for color themes that report red, green, blue and hex values. I often use the coolors.co website to look for themes that go well together for slides or presentations.\nColor Brewer Finally, there is an interesting website at colorbrewer2.org that has some interesting built-in palettes. There is an associated library that makes creating palettes for plots really easy and as you get more expreienced with R, you will find this very helpful. For quick visualizations and estimation of built-in color palettes, you can look at the website (below).\n or look at the colors in R\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\ndisplay.brewer.all()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three basic kinds of palettes: divergent, qualitative, and sequential. Each of these built-in palletes has a maximum number of colors available (though as you see below we can use them to interpolate larger sets) as well as indications if the palette is safe for colorblind individuals.\n\nbrewer.pal.info\n\n         maxcolors category colorblind\nBrBG            11      div       TRUE\nPiYG            11      div       TRUE\nPRGn            11      div       TRUE\nPuOr            11      div       TRUE\nRdBu            11      div       TRUE\nRdGy            11      div      FALSE\nRdYlBu          11      div       TRUE\nRdYlGn          11      div      FALSE\nSpectral        11      div      FALSE\nAccent           8     qual      FALSE\nDark2            8     qual       TRUE\nPaired          12     qual       TRUE\nPastel1          9     qual      FALSE\nPastel2          8     qual      FALSE\nSet1             9     qual      FALSE\nSet2             8     qual       TRUE\nSet3            12     qual      FALSE\nBlues            9      seq       TRUE\nBuGn             9      seq       TRUE\nBuPu             9      seq       TRUE\nGnBu             9      seq       TRUE\nGreens           9      seq       TRUE\nGreys            9      seq       TRUE\nOranges          9      seq       TRUE\nOrRd             9      seq       TRUE\nPuBu             9      seq       TRUE\nPuBuGn           9      seq       TRUE\nPuRd             9      seq       TRUE\nPurples          9      seq       TRUE\nRdPu             9      seq       TRUE\nReds             9      seq       TRUE\nYlGn             9      seq       TRUE\nYlGnBu           9      seq       TRUE\nYlOrBr           9      seq       TRUE\nYlOrRd           9      seq       TRUE\n\n\nIt is very helpful to look at the different kinds of data palettes available and I’ll show you how to use them below when we color in the states based upon population size at the end of this document."

R could take two routes:\n\nIt could ignore the data and give you the answer directly as if the data were not missing, or\n\nIt could let you know that there is missing data and make you do something about it.\n\nFortunately, R took the second route.\nAn example from the iris data, I’m going to add some missing data to it.\n\nmissingIris &lt;- iris[, 4:5]\nmissingIris$Petal.Width[ c(2,6,12) ] &lt;- NA\nsummary( missingIris )\n\n  Petal.Width          Species  \n Min.   :0.100   setosa    :50  \n 1st Qu.:0.300   versicolor:50  \n Median :1.300   virginica :50  \n Mean   :1.218                  \n 3rd Qu.:1.800                  \n Max.   :2.500                  \n NA's   :3                      \n\n\nNotice how the missing data is denoted in the summary.\n\nIndications of Missing Data\nWhen we perform a mathematical or statistical operation on data that has missing elements R will always return NA as the result.\n\nmean( missingIris$Petal.Width )\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThis warns you that .red[at least one] of the observations in the data is missing.\nSame output for using by(), it will put NA into each level that has at least one missing value.\n\nby( missingIris$Petal.Width, missingIris$Species, mean )\n\nmissingIris$Species: setosa\n[1] NA\n------------------------------------------------------------ \nmissingIris$Species: versicolor\n[1] 1.326\n------------------------------------------------------------ \nmissingIris$Species: virginica\n[1] 2.026\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Missing Data\nTo acknowledge that there are missing data and you still want the values, you need to tell the function you are using that data is missing and you are OK with that using the optional argument na.rm=TRUE (na = missing data & rm is remove).\n\nmean( missingIris$Petal.Width, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n[1] 1.218367\n\n\nTo pass this to the by() function, we add the optional argument na.rm=TRUE and by() passes it along to the mean function as “…”\n\nby( missingIris$Petal.Width, missingIris$Species, mean, na.rm=TRUE )\n\nmissingIris$Species: setosa\n[1] 0.2446809\n------------------------------------------------------------ \nmissingIris$Species: versicolor\n[1] 1.326\n------------------------------------------------------------ \nmissingIris$Species: virginica\n[1] 2.026"

By default, when you start R you are given a Global Environment Scope that has all the variables and functions you’ve defined thus far. The image below is the one for this document at this stage of development.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Main Environment in RStudio\n\n\nWhen we work with functions, we encapsulate code within curly-brackets. This protects their scope. Her is an example. In this function, we:\n\nPrint out the value of a variable x\n\nAssign values to the variables x and z\nPrint out the value of the variables x and z.\n\n\nfoo &lt;- function( ) {\n  x &lt;- 12\n  z &lt;- \"bob\"\n  cat(\"x =\", x, \"& z =\", z ,\"inside function.\\n\")\n}\n\nOK, so now let’s call this function.\n\nfoo()\n\nx = 12 & z = bob inside function.\n\n\n\nx &lt;- 42\ncat(\"x =\", x, \"before function.\\n\")\n\nx = 42 before function.\n\nfoo()\n\nx = 12 & z = bob inside function.\n\ncat(\"x =\", x, \"after running function.\\n\")\n\nx = 42 after running function.\n\n\nNOTE: The value of x was changed within the function but those changes were not reflected OUTSIDE of that function. The scope of the variable x inside foo() is local to that function and anything that follows its declaration within the curly brackets of the function. However, it is invisible outside the scope of that function. This is a ‘good thing©’ because if we had visibility of all the variables in all the functions then we would either a) quickly run out of variable names to keep them unique, or b) clobber all of our existing variables by writing over them and changing their values.\nAlso, notice that the variable z that is assigned bob in the function is also not visible in the global environment. What happens in the function, stays in the function.\n\nls()\n\n[1] \"foo\" \"x\""

They must contain data of the exact same type and are constructed using the combine() function, which is abbreviated as c() because good programmers are lazy programmers. 1\nHere is an example with some numbers.\n\nx &lt;- c(1,2,3)\nx\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nVectors can contain any of the base data types.\n\ny &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)\ny\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\nz &lt;- c(\"Bob\",\"Alice\",\"Thomas\")\nz\n\n[1] \"Bob\"    \"Alice\"  \"Thomas\"\n\n\nEach vector has an inherent length representing the number of elements it contains.\n\nlength(x)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\nIntrospection\nWhen asked, a vector reports the class of itself as the type of data contained within it.\n\nclass(x)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(y)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\nclass(z)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nhowever, a vector is also a data type. As such, it has the is.vector() function. So this x can be both a vector and a numeric.\n\nis.vector( x ) && is.numeric( x )\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nSequences\nThere are a lot of times when we require a sequnce of values and it would get a bit tedious to type them all out manually. R has several options for creating vectors that are comprised of a sequence of values.\nThe easiest type is the colon operator, that will generate a seqeunce of numerical values from the number on the left to the number on the right\n\n1:10 -&gt; y\ny\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nIt also works in the other direction (descending).\n\n10:1\n\n [1] 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1\n\n\nHowever, it is only available to make a sequences where the increment from one value to the next is 1.\n\n3.2:5.7\n\n[1] 3.2 4.2 5.2\n\n\nFor more fine-grained control, we can use the function seq() to iterate across a range of values and specify either the step size (here from 1-10 by 3’s)\n\nseq(1,10,by=3)\n\n[1]  1  4  7 10\n\n\nOR the length of the response and it will figure out the step size to give you the right number of elements.\n\nseq( 119, 121, length.out = 6)\n\n[1] 119.0 119.4 119.8 120.2 120.6 121.0\n\n\n\n\nIndexing & Access\nTo access and change values within a vector, we used square brackets and the number of the entry of interest. It should be noted that in R, the first element of a vector is # 1.\nSo, to get to the third element of the x vector, we would:\n\nx[3]\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nIf you ask for values in the vector off the end (e.g., the index is beyond the length of the vector) it will return missing data.\n\nx[5]\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nIn addition to getting the values from a vector, assignment of individual values proceeds similarily.\n\nx[2] &lt;- 42\nx\n\n[1]  1 42  3\n\n\nIf you assign a value to a vector that is way off the end, it will fill in the intermediate values wtih NA for you.\n\nx[7] &lt;- 43\nx\n\n[1]  1 42  3 NA NA NA 43\n\n\n\n\nVector Operations\nJust like individual values for each data type, vectors of these data types can also be operated using the same operators. Consider the two vectors x (a sequence) and y (a random selection from a Poisson distribution), both with 5 elements.\n\nx &lt;- 1:5\ny &lt;- rpois(5,2)\nx\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\ny\n\n[1] 4 2 2 2 5\n\n\nMathematics operations are done element-wise. Here is an example using addition.\n\nx + y \n\n[1]  5  4  5  6 10\n\n\nas well as exponents.\n\nx^y\n\n[1]    1    4    9   16 3125\n\n\nIf the lengths of the vectors are not the same R will implement a recycling rule where the shorter of the vectors is repeated until you fill up the size of the longer vector. Here is an example with the 5-element x and the a new 10-element z. Notice how the values in x are repeated in the addition operaiton.\n\nz &lt;- 1:10\nx + z\n\n [1]  2  4  6  8 10  7  9 11 13 15\n\n\nIf the two vectors are not multiples of each other in length, it will still recycle the shorter one but will also give you a warning that the two vectors are not conformant (just a FYI).\n\nx + 1:8\n\nWarning in x + 1:8: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object\nlength\n\n\n[1]  2  4  6  8 10  7  9 11\n\n\nThe operations used are dependent upon the base data type. For example, the following character values can be passed along to the paste() function to put each of the elements in the first vectoer with the corresponding values in the second vector (and specifying the separator).\n\na &lt;- c(\"Bob\",\"Alice\",\"Thomas\")\nb &lt;- c(\"Biologist\",\"Chemist\",\"Mathematician\")\npaste( a, b, sep=\" is a \")\n\n[1] \"Bob is a Biologist\"        \"Alice is a Chemist\"       \n[3] \"Thomas is a Mathematician\"\n\n\nSo, in addition to being able to work on individual values, all functions are also vector functions."

Also, just like vectors, both rows and columns start at 1 (not zero). So to replace the value in the second row and second column with the number 42, we do this.\n\nX[2,2] &lt;- 42\nX\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    4    7\n[2,]    2   42    8\n[3,]    3    6    9\n\n\nMatrices are actually structures fundamental to things like linear algebra. As such, there are many operations that can be applied to matrices, both unary and binary.\nA transpose is a translation of a matrix that switches the rows and columns.

Both matrices have the same internal data types.\nHere is an example of addition (notic how the resulting [1,1] object is equal to X[1,1] + Y[1,1])\n\nX + Y\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    2    6   10\n[2,]    6   84   14\n[3,]   10   14   18\n\n\nThe same for element-wise multiplication.\n\nX * Y\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    8   21\n[2,]    8 1764   48\n[3,]   21   48   81\n\n\nHowever, there is another kind of matrix mutliplication that sums the product or rows and columns. Since this is also a variety of multiplication but is carried out differently, we need to use a different operator. Here the matrix mutliplication operator is denoted as the combination of characters %*%.\n\nX %*% Y\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   66  226   90\n[2,]  226 1832  330\n[3,]   90  330  126\n\n\nThis operation has a few different constraints:\n\nThe number of columns in the left matrix must equal the number of rows in the right one.\nThe resulting matrix will have the number of rows equal to that of the right matrix.\nThe resulting matrix will have the number of columns equal to that of the left matrix.\nThe resulting element at the \\(i\\) \\(j\\) position is the sum of the multipliation of the elements in the \\(i^{th}\\) row of the left matrix and the \\(j^{th}\\) column of the right one.\n\nSo the resulting element in [1,3] position is found by \\(1*3 + 4*6 + 7*9 = 90\\)."

    "section": "Lists",
    "text": "Lists\nLists are a more flexible container type. Here, lists can contain different types of data in a single list. Here is an example of a list made with a few character vluaes, a numeric, a constant, and a logical value.\n\nlst &lt;- list(\"A\",\"B\",323423.3, pi, TRUE)\n\nWhen you print out a list made like this, it will indicate each element as a numeric value in double square brackets.\n\nlst\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"A\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"B\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 323423.3\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 3.141593\n\n[[5]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nIndexing\nIndexing values in a list can be done using these numbers. To get and reset the values in the second element of the list, one would:\n\nlst[[2]] &lt;- \"C\"\nlst\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"A\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"C\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 323423.3\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 3.141593\n\n[[5]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nNamed Lists\nLists can be more valuable if we use names for the keys instead of just numbers. Here, I make an empty list and then assign values to it using names (as character values) in square brakets.\n\nmyInfo &lt;- list()\nmyInfo[\"First Name\"] &lt;- \"Rodney\"\nmyInfo[\"Second Name\"] &lt;- \"Dyer\"\nmyInfo[\"Favorite Number\"] &lt;- 42\n\nWhen showing named lists, it prints included items as:\n\nmyInfo\n\n$`First Name`\n[1] \"Rodney\"\n\n$`Second Name`\n[1] \"Dyer\"\n\n$`Favorite Number`\n[1] 42\n\n\nIn addition to the square bracket approach, we can also use as $ notation to add elements to the list (like shown above).\n\nmyInfo$Vegitarian &lt;- FALSE\n\nBoth are equivallent.\n\nmyInfo\n\n$`First Name`\n[1] \"Rodney\"\n\n$`Second Name`\n[1] \"Dyer\"\n\n$`Favorite Number`\n[1] 42\n\n$Vegitarian\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nIn addition to having different data types, you can also have different sized data types inside a list. Here I add a vector (a valid data type as shown above) to the list.\n\nmyInfo$Homes &lt;- c(\"RVA\",\"Oly\",\"SEA\")\nmyInfo\n\n$`First Name`\n[1] \"Rodney\"\n\n$`Second Name`\n[1] \"Dyer\"\n\n$`Favorite Number`\n[1] 42\n\n$Vegitarian\n[1] FALSE\n\n$Homes\n[1] \"RVA\" \"Oly\" \"SEA\"\n\n\nTo access these values, we can use a combination of $ notation and [] on the resulting vector.\n\nmyInfo$Homes[2]\n\n[1] \"Oly\"\n\n\nWhen elements in a list are defined using named keys, the list itself can be asked for the keys using names().\n\nnames(myInfo)\n\n[1] \"First Name\"      \"Second Name\"     \"Favorite Number\" \"Vegitarian\"     \n[5] \"Homes\"          \n\n\nThis can be helpful at times when you did not create the list yourself and want to see what is inside of them.\n\n\nSpaces in Names\nAs you see above, this list has keys such as “First Name” and “Vegitarian”. The first one has a space inside of it whereas the second one does not. This is a challenge. If we were to try to use the first key as\n\nmyInfo$First Name\n\nWould give you an error (if I ran the chunck but I cannot because it is an error and won’t let me compile this document if I do). For names that have spaces, we need to enclose them inside back-ticks (as shown in the output above).\n\nmyInfo$`First Name`\n\n[1] \"Rodney\"\n\n\nSo feel free to use names that make sense, but if you do, you’ll need to treat them a bit specially using the backticks.\n\n\nAnalysis Output\nBy far, the most common location for lists is when you do some kind of analysis. Almost all analyses return the restuls as a special kind of list.\nHere is an example looking at some data from three species of Iris on the lengths and width of sepal and petals. The data look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The distribution of sepal and petal lengths from three species of Iris.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can look at the correlation between two variable using the built-in cor.test() function.\n\niris.test &lt;- cor.test( iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length )\n\nWe can print the output and it will format the results in a proper way.\n\niris.test\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  iris$Sepal.Length and iris$Petal.Length\nt = 21.646, df = 148, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.8270363 0.9055080\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.8717538 \n\n\nHowever, the elements in the iris.test are simply a list.\n\nnames(iris.test)\n\n[1] \"statistic\"   \"parameter\"   \"p.value\"     \"estimate\"    \"null.value\" \n[6] \"alternative\" \"method\"      \"data.name\"   \"conf.int\"   \n\n\nIf fact, the contents of the output are just keys and values, even though when we printed it all out, it was formatted as a much more informative output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\nstatistic.t\n21.6460193457598\n\n\nparameter.df\n148\n\n\np.value\n1.03866741944978e-47\n\n\nestimate.cor\n0.871753775886583\n\n\nnull.value.correlation\n0\n\n\nalternative\ntwo.sided\n\n\nmethod\nPearson's product-moment correlation\n\n\ndata.name\niris$Sepal.Length and iris$Petal.Length\n\n\nconf.int1\n0.827036329664362\n\n\nconf.int2\n0.905508048821454\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will come back to this special kind of printing later when discussing functions but for now, lets just consider how cool this is because we can access the raw values of the analysis directly. We an also easily incorporate the findings of analyses, such as this simple correlation test, and insert the content into the text. All you have to do is address the components of the analysis as in-text r citation. Here is an example where I include the values of:\n\niris.test$estimate\n\n      cor \n0.8717538 \n\niris.test$statistic\n\n       t \n21.64602 \n\niris.test$p.value\n\n[1] 1.038667e-47\n\n\nHere is an example paragraph (see the raw quarto document to see the formatting).\n\nThere was a significant relationship between sepal and petal length (Pearson Correlation, \\(\\rho =\\) 0.872, \\(t =\\) 21.6, P = 1.04e-47)."

    "section": "Data Frames",
    "text": "Data Frames\nThe data.frame is the most common container for all the data you’ll be working with in R. It is kind of like a spreadsheet in that each column of data is the same kind of data measured on all objects (e.g., weight, survival, population, etc.) and each row represents one observation that has a bunch of different kinds of measurements associated with it.\nHere is an example with three different data types (the z is a random sample of TRUE/FALSE equal in length to the other elements).\n\nx &lt;- 1:10\ny &lt;- LETTERS[11:20]\nz &lt;- sample( c(TRUE,FALSE), size=10, replace=TRUE )\n\nI can put them into a data.frame object as:\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame( TheNums = x,\n                  TheLetters = y,\n                  TF = z\n                  )\ndf\n\n   TheNums TheLetters    TF\n1        1          K  TRUE\n2        2          L  TRUE\n3        3          M  TRUE\n4        4          N  TRUE\n5        5          O FALSE\n6        6          P FALSE\n7        7          Q FALSE\n8        8          R  TRUE\n9        9          S  TRUE\n10      10          T  TRUE\n\n\nSince each column is its own ‘type’ we can easily get a summary of the elements within it using summary().\n\nsummary( df )\n\n    TheNums       TheLetters            TF         \n Min.   : 1.00   Length:10          Mode :logical  \n 1st Qu.: 3.25   Class :character   FALSE:3        \n Median : 5.50   Mode  :character   TRUE :7        \n Mean   : 5.50                                     \n 3rd Qu.: 7.75                                     \n Max.   :10.00                                     \n\n\nAnd depending upon the data type, the output may give numerical, counts, or just description of the contents.\n\nIndexing\nJust like a list, a data.frame can be defined as having named columns. The distinction here is that each column should have the same number of elements in it, whereas a list may have differnet lengths to the elements.\n\nnames( df )\n\n[1] \"TheNums\"    \"TheLetters\" \"TF\"        \n\n\nAnd like the list, we can easily use the $ operator to access the vectors components.\n\ndf$TheLetters\n\n [1] \"K\" \"L\" \"M\" \"N\" \"O\" \"P\" \"Q\" \"R\" \"S\" \"T\"\n\nclass( df$TheLetters )\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIndexing and grabbing elements can be done by either the column name (with $) and a square bracket OR by the [row,col] indexing like the matrix above.\n\ndf$TheLetters[3]\n\n[1] \"M\"\n\ndf[3,2]\n\n[1] \"M\"\n\n\nJust like a matrix, the dimensions of the data.frame is defined by the number of rows and columns.\n\ndim( df )\n\n[1] 10  3\n\nnrow( df )\n\n[1] 10\n\nncol( df )\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\nLoading Data\nBy far, you will most often NOT be making data by hand but instead will be loading it from external locations. here is an example of how we can load in a CSV file that is located in the GitHub repository for this topic. As this is a public repository, we can get a direct URL to the file. For simplicity, I’ll load in tidyverse and use some helper functions contained therein.\n\nlibrary( tidyverse )\n\nThe URL for this repository is\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DyerlabTeaching/Data-Containers/main/data/arapat.csv\"\n\nAnd we can read it in directly (as long as we have an internet connection) as:\n\nbeetles &lt;- read_csv( url )\n\nRows: 39 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): Stratum\ndbl (2): Longitude, Latitude\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nNotice how the funtion tells us a few things about the data.\nThe data itself consists of:\n\nsummary( beetles )\n\n   Stratum            Longitude         Latitude    \n Length:39          Min.   :-114.3   Min.   :23.08  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:-112.9   1st Qu.:24.52  \n Mode  :character   Median :-111.5   Median :26.21  \n                    Mean   :-111.7   Mean   :26.14  \n                    3rd Qu.:-110.4   3rd Qu.:27.47  \n                    Max.   :-109.1   Max.   :29.33  \n\n\nwhich looks like:\n\nbeetles\n\n# A tibble: 39 × 3\n   Stratum Longitude Latitude\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 88          -114.     29.3\n 2 9           -114.     29.0\n 3 84          -114.     29.0\n 4 175         -113.     28.7\n 5 177         -114.     28.7\n 6 173         -113.     28.4\n 7 171         -113.     28.2\n 8 89          -113.     28.0\n 9 159         -113.     27.5\n10 SFr         -113.     27.4\n# ℹ 29 more rows\n\n\nWe can quickly use these data and make an interactive labeled map of it in a few lines of code (click on a marker).\n\nlibrary( leaflet )\nbeetles %&gt;%\n  leaflet() %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(provider = providers$Esri.WorldTopo) %&gt;%\n  addMarkers( ~Longitude, ~Latitude,popup = ~Stratum )"

    "text": "Code & Text\nOn of the strengths of RMarkdown is the ability to mix code and text together in one place. This allows us to bring all of our analyses and data as close to one another as possible, helping with reproducibility and error reduction.\n\nInline Code\nYou can easily integrate code, into the text, either to be displayed OR to be evaluated. For example, in R you get the value of \\(\\pi\\) by the constant pi. Type that into the console and it will return 3.1415927.\nIf you look at the RMarkdown for that paragraph above, it looks like the following before knitting:\nYou can easily integrate code, into the text, either to be displayed *OR* to be evaluated.  For example, in `R` you get the value of $\\pi$ by the constant `pi`. Type that into the console and it will return 3.1415927.\nNotice the following parts:\n\nSymbols: The \\(\\pi\\) symbol is created by the name of the symbol surrounded by dollar signs. $ $. There are a ton of symbols and equations you can use, all borrowed from LaTeX, so if you need complicated equations or symbols, this is not a problem.\nText rendered as code (in typography) but not evaluated: Both the `R` and the `pi` are examples here. Nothing is evaluated, but it looks like code.\nEvaluated R Code: Any code between \\rand`will be evaluated as R code within the text. When you knit the document, it will be run and the contents between the`rand`are replaced by the output of theRcode. The example here was \\pi` at the end of the last sentence.\n\n\n\nCode Chunks\nIn addition to code within the text, RMarkdown supports code chunks, which can be one or many lines of raw R code. This code is executed and the results are merged into the markdown in the document (text, graphical, interactive widgets, whatever) before knitting.\nEach chunk is enclosed within boundary rows, the top row must contain three acute accents (back ticks - `) followed by the letter r in curly brackets ```{r}. The end of the chunk is indicated by three back ticks on their own line such as ```. Everything between these two enclosing lines is treated as R code and is subject to evaluation when you re-knit the document.\nHere is what a chunk looks like in markdown that prints out a simple message “This is text from a chunk.\n```{r}\nprint(“This is text from a chunk”)\n```\nWhen it is evaluated, the R interpreter removes the first and last rows, and executes the code within them. By default, the code is presented as a box in the output as well as any output that is produced from the code.\n\nprint(\"This is text from a chunk\")\n\n[1] \"This is text from a chunk\"\n\n\nThe first line in the chunk can also be used to modify the behavior of the code. There are several options that you can place within the curly brackets, including:\n\n{r eval=FALSE}: Will not evaluate (e.g., run) the code. The default value is TRUE.\n\n{r echo=FALSE}: Will not show the code in the document. This is great for our final version of our analyses, we want the output but not the code chunks showing. The default value is TRUE.\n\n{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}: These suppress the messages that R prints out on occasion.\n\nSee the reference guide for several more options you can put into the header of each chunk."

If you make a change in a chunk, you must rerun that chunk to have the output available and inserted into the Environment. It does not do it automagically.\nWhen you knit a document, the only data it has is what is actually in the document itself. It does not look to the general Environment for variables and functions. This means that if you create a variable or load data using the Console and then reference it in the Document, it will fail when you try to knit the document.\nAll the code and variables in a document (if they are not within a chunk with eval=FALSE) is visible to everything in the document below where it was defined.\n\nChunks are evaluated from the top of the document to the bottom of the document.\n\nThe options for each chunk are available from the setup menu on the top right of the chunk itself (the gear icon).

Develop quantitative skills for the visualization, manipulation, analysis, and communication of environmental “big data.” This course focuses on spatial environmental data analysis, interpretation, and communication, using real-time data from the Rice Rivers Center and the R statistical analysis environment.\n\n\n\nTo understand data analytics, one needs to recognize the entire workflow. Below is a brief graphical depiction of how analysis actualin the real world. In this class, we will work on all of the components using the open-source R language.\n\nCollect: Getting data from an external source into a format that you use is often the most time-consuming step in the analysis. The content of this class will provide training in data import from local, online, and database sources.\n\nVisualize: Visualizing data is key to understanding. In the image below, notice that the variables X and Y in all the displayed data sets have equivalent means, standard deviations, and correlation up to 2 decimal places! We will emphasize visualization, both static and dynamic, throughout this class.\n\nTransform: Pulling data into your analysis ecosystem is not sufficient. Often the data need to be reformatted and reconfigured before it is actually used.\n\nModel: The application of models to subsets of data is often the step that takes the least amount of effort. However, the application of a model to data is not the endpoint. The model must be visualized and, many times, the underlying data or derivate data must be transformed and submitted to subsequent models.\n\nCommunicate: The effort we put into research and analyses is meaningless without effective communication of your data and findings to a broad audience.

The overarching goal here is to develop a working knowledge of the R statistical computing language and enough proficiency to import raw data and then iterate through the visualization, manipulation, and analysis steps in the creation of output that is easily communicated to a scientific audience.\nThe content of this course is built upon the following general student learning objectives (SLO):\n\nSLO 1: Identity, manipulate, and summarize numerical, categorical, ordinal, logical, date, string, and spatial data types.\nSLO 2: Create habits and took the knowledge to support reproducible research.\nSLO 3: Create an informative and effective graphical display of various data types of suitable quality for inclusion in published manuscripts.\nSLO 4: Effectively choose appropriate statistical models based on the types of data at hand and the questions being addressed.\nSLO 5: Demonstrate a general understanding of spatial data types and the creation of both appropriate static and dynamic maps.\n\n\n\n\nThis course is designed as a sequence of individual, stand-alone modules.

    "text": "One Sample Hypotheses\nAt the most basic level, we can take a set of data and test to see if the mean of those values are equated to some particular value, \\(H_O: \\mu = x\\) (or \\(H_O: \\mu = 0\\) in some cases). The idea here is to determine, by specifying a value for the null hypothesis, what we expect the mean value to be equal to. Going back to our idea of hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis is the thing we are trying to disprove (with some level of statistical confidence) and in doing so we need to define a test statistic that we have an idea about its behavior. In this case, we will define Student’s \\(t\\)-test statistic as:\n\\(t =\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{s_{\\bar{x}}}\\)\nwhere \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the observed mean of the data, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean value specified under the null hypothesis, and \\(s_{\\bar{x}}\\) is the standard deviation of the data. The value of the \\(t\\)-statistic can be defined based upon the sample size (e.g., the degrees of freedom, \\(df\\)). Here is what the probability density function looks like for \\(df = (1,3,\\infty)\\).\n\nlibrary( ggplot2 )\nx &lt;- seq(-5,5,by=0.02)\nd &lt;- data.frame( t=c(x,x,x),\n                  f=c(dt(x,df=1),\n                      dt(x,df=3),\n                      dt(x,df=Inf)),\n                  df=rep(c(\"1\",\"3\",\"Inf\"),each=length(x)))\nggplot( d, aes(x=t,y=f,color=df)) + geom_line() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \\(df=\\infty\\) then \\(PDF(t) = Normal\\). As such, we do not need to make corrections to understand the area under the curve, we can just use the normal probability density function. In fact, when \\(df=\\infty\\) then \\(t_{\\alpha,\\infty} = Z_{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{\\chi^2_{\\alpha,df=1}}\\)! The take home message here is that all your statistics become much easier when \\(N=\\infty\\), so go collect some more data!\nFor \\(df &lt; \\infty\\) (all the cases we will be dealing with), we will use the approximation defined by the \\(t\\) distribution. If you look at the distributions above, you see that as we increase the number of samples (e.g., as \\(df\\) increases), the distribution becomes more restricted. The actual function is defined (where \\(df = v\\) for simplicity in nomenclature) as:\n\\(P(t|x,v)= \\frac{ \\Gamma\\left( \\frac{v+1}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{v\\pi}\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{v}{2}\\right)} \\left( 1 + \\frac{x^2}{v}\\right)^{-\\frac{v+1}{2}}\\)\nwhere \\(\\Gamma\\) is the Gamma function. Not pretty! Fortunately, we have some built-in facilities in R that can make it easy for us.\nFor a single set of data, we can use the function above to estimate a value of the \\(t\\) statistic. The probability distribution, defined by the degrees of freedom, identifies regions within which we may suspect the statistic to be abnormally large. In our case, though it is quite arbitrary, we can define either one or two regions of the distribution whose values would be extreme enough such that we would consider a significant deviation. For a two-tailed test, the distribution below illustrates this concept. If the estimated value of the \\(t\\) statistic is in either of the shaded regions, we would reject the null hypothesis of \\(H_O: \\mu = 0\\) where \\(\\alpha=0.05\\).\n\nd1 &lt;- data.frame(t=c( seq(-5,-2.064, by=0.02), -2.064, -5), \n                 f=c( dt( seq(-5,-2.064, by=0.02),df=1), 0.01224269, 0.01224269))\nd2 &lt;- data.frame(t=c( seq(2.064,5,by=0.02), 5, 2.064),\n                 f=c( dt( seq( 2.064, 5, by=0.02),df=1), 0.01224269, 0.01224269))\nd3 &lt;- data.frame( x=c(2.5,-2.5), y=0.02719, label=\"2.5%\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_polygon(aes(t,f),data=d1, fill=\"#F8766D\",alpha=0.5,color=\"#F8766D\") + \n  geom_polygon(aes(t,f),data=d2, fill=\"#F8766D\",alpha=0.5,color=\"#F8766D\") + \n  geom_line( aes(t,f),data=d[d$df==1,], color=\"#F8766D\") + \n  geom_text( aes(x,y,label=label),data=d3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, we can use the t.test() function. I’m going to go back to the Iris data set and use that as it has three categories (the species) and many measurements on sepals and pedals. Here I separate the species into their own data.frame objects.\n\ndf.se &lt;- iris[ iris$Species == \"setosa\",] \ndf.ve &lt;- iris[ iris$Species == \"versicolor\",] \ndf.vi &lt;- iris[ iris$Species == \"virginica\",]\n\nLets look at the Sepal.Length feature in these species and create some hypotheses about it.\n\nggplot( iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, fill=Species)) + geom_density(alpha=0.75)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could test the hypothesis, \\(H_O: mean(Sepal.Length)=6\\) for each of the species.\n\nfit.se &lt;- t.test(df.se$Sepal.Length, mu = 6.0)\nfit.se\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  df.se$Sepal.Length\nt = -19.94, df = 49, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 6\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 4.905824 5.106176\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n    5.006 \n\n\nFrom the output, it appears that we can reject that null hypothesis (\\(t =\\) -19.9; \\(df =\\) 49; \\(P =\\) 3.7e-25).\nFor I. versicolor, we see that the mean does appear to be equal to 6.0 (and thus fail to reject the null hypothesis):\n\nt.test( df.ve$Sepal.Length, mu=6.0 )\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  df.ve$Sepal.Length\nt = -0.87674, df = 49, p-value = 0.3849\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 6\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 5.789306 6.082694\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n    5.936 \n\n\nand for I. virginica, we find that it is significantly larger than 6.0 and again reject the null hypothesis:\n\nt.test( df.vi$Sepal.Length, mu=6.0 )\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  df.vi$Sepal.Length\nt = 6.5386, df = 49, p-value = 3.441e-08\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 6\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 6.407285 6.768715\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n    6.588 \n\n\nIn all the output, we are also given an estimate of the Confidence Interval around the mean. This confidence interval is determined as:\n\\(\\bar{x} - t_{\\alpha, df} s_{\\bar{x}} &lt; \\mu &lt; \\bar{x} + t_{\\alpha, df} s_{\\bar{x}}\\)\nor the mean plus or minus standard deviation of the data times the value of the \\(t\\)-statistic for a given level of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(df\\).\n\nData Variability\nThere are times when reporting some confidence around a parameter is important, particularly when using tabular data as output.\n\nSpecies &lt;- c(\"Iris setosa\",\"Iris versicolor\",\"Iris virginia\")\nSepal.Length &lt;- c(mean(df.se$Sepal.Length), mean(df.ve$Sepal.Length), mean( df.vi$Sepal.Length))\nSepal.Length.SE &lt;- c(sd(df.se$Sepal.Length), sd(df.ve$Sepal.Length), sd( df.vi$Sepal.Length))\nSepal.Length.SEM &lt;- Sepal.Length.SE / sqrt(50)\n\nThere are two ways we can talk about the data and it is important for you to think about what you are trying to communicate to your readers. These alternatives include:\n\nsd &lt;- paste( format(Sepal.Length,digits=2), \"+/-\", format(Sepal.Length.SE, digits=3))\nse &lt;- paste( format(Sepal.Length,digits=2), \"+/-\", format(Sepal.Length.SEM, digits=3))\ndf &lt;- data.frame( Species, sd, se )\nnames(df) &lt;- c(\"Species\",\"Mean +/- SD\", \"Sepal Length +/- SE\")\nknitr::kable(df,row.names = FALSE,digits = 3,align = \"lcc\")\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nMean +/- SD\nSepal Length +/- SE\n\n\n\n\nIris setosa\n5.0 +/- 0.352\n5.0 +/- 0.0498\n\n\nIris versicolor\n5.9 +/- 0.516\n5.9 +/- 0.0730\n\n\nIris virginia\n6.6 +/- 0.636\n6.6 +/- 0.0899\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two columns of data tell us something different. The middle column tells us the mean and the standard deviation of the data. This tells us about the variability (and confidence) of the data itself. The last column is the Standard Error of the Mean (\\(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}}\\)) and gives us an idea of the confidence we have about the mean estimate of the data (as opposed to the variation of the data itself). These are two different statements about the data and you need to make sure you are confident about which way you want to use to communicate to your audience."

    "text": "Two Sample Hypotheses\nIn addition to a single sample test, evaluating if the mean of a set of data is equal to some specified value, we can test the equality of two different samples. It may be the case that the average sepal length for I. versicolor is not significantly different than 6.0 whereas I. virginia is. However, this does not mean that the mean of both of these species are significantly different from each other. This is a two-sampled hypothesis, stating that \\(H_O: \\mu_X = \\mu_Y\\).\nVisually, these data look like:\n\ndf &lt;- iris[ (iris$Species %in% c(\"versicolor\",\"virginica\")),]\nggplot( df, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length)) + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich clearly overlap in their distributions but are the mean values different? This sets up the null hypothesis:\n\\(H_O: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\)\nUnder this hypothesis, we can use a t-test like before but just rearranged as:\n\\(t = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{s_{\\bar{x}_1-\\bar{x}_2}}\\)\nAs before, if the difference in the numerator is small we would reject but here we need to standardize the differences in the means by a measure of the standard deviation that is based upon both sets of data. This is called a the standard error of the difference in two means (real catchy title, no?). This is defined as:\n\\(s_{\\bar{x}_1-\\bar{x}_2} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{s_1^2}{N_1}+\\frac{s_2^2}{N}}\\)\nTo test this, we use the same approach as before but instead of defining \\(\\mu = 6.0\\) in the t.test() function, we instead give it both data sets.\n\nt.test( x=df.vi$Sepal.Length, y = df.ve$Sepal.Length )\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  df.vi$Sepal.Length and df.ve$Sepal.Length\nt = 5.6292, df = 94.025, p-value = 1.866e-07\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4220269 0.8819731\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n    6.588     5.936 \n\n\nHere we get a few bits of new information from the analysis. It is obvious that we would reject the null hypothesis given the magnitude of the estimated \\(P\\)-value. The output also provides us an estimate of the mean values for each group as well as the confidence around the difference in the mean values. This confidence interval does not overlap 0.0, as it shouldn’t if we reject \\(H_O: \\mu_X = \\mu_Y\\)."

    "section": "Many Sample Hypotheses",
    "text": "Many Sample Hypotheses\nIf we have more than two samples, we could do a bunch of paired \\(t\\)-test statistics but this is not the best idea. In fact, if we do this to our data, each time testing at a confidence level of, say, \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), then for each time we test at \\(0.05\\) but over all pairs, we test at an overall level of \\(0.05^k\\) (where \\(k\\) is the number of tests) value. We cannot do multiple tests without penalizing ourselves in terms of the level at which we consider something significant if we are going to do all these tests. You may have heard about a Bonferroni correction—this does exactly that, it allows us to modify the \\(\\alpha\\) level we use to take into consideration the number of tests we are going to use. While this may be an acceptable way to test for the equality of several means (and it may not actually be if you ask most statisticians), there is another way that is much easier.\nConsider the case where we have many categories (e.g., factors in R) that we are interested in determining if the mean of all are equal. The null hypothesis for this is, \\(H_O: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\ldots = \\mu_k\\), where there are \\(k\\) different treatment levels. This is essentially what we’d want to do by doing a bunch of \\(t\\)-tests but we can use another approach that we don’t have to penalize ourselves for multiple tests. Here is how it works.\nIn the Iris data, we can visualize the means and variation around them by using box plots. Here is an example.\n\nggplot( iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length)) + \n  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) + \n  ylab(\"Sepal Length\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor us to tell if there are statistical differences among the species, we need to look at both the location of the mean values as well as the variation around them. We do this by partitioning the variation in all the data into the components within each treatment (species) and among each treatment (species) using an approach derived from the sum of squared deviations (or Sums of Squares). Formally, we can estimate the sum of squares within each of the \\(K\\) groupings as:\n\\(SS_{Within} = \\sum_{i=1}^K\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{N_i}(x_{ij}-\\bar{x}_i)^2 \\right)\\)\nwhose degrees of freedom are defined as:\n\\(df_{W} = \\sum_{i=1}^K \\left( N_i - 1 \\right) = N-K\\)\nThese parameters represent the deviation among samples within groups and the number of independent samples within these groups. We also need to partition out the variation among groups as a similarly defined Sums of Squares:\n\\(SS_{Among} = \\sum_{i=1}^K N_i\\left( \\bar{x}_i - \\bar{x} \\right)^2\\)\nor the deviation among the mean of each treatment compared to the overall mean of all the data. This parameter has degrees of freedom equal to\n\\(df_{A} = K - 1\\)\nThese two parameters describe all the data and as such \\(SS_{Total} = SS_{Within} + SS_{Among}\\). Formally, we see that\n\\(SS_{Total} = \\sum_{i=1}^K\\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} (x_{ij} - \\bar{x})^2\\)\nwhose degrees of freedom are\n\\(df_{T} = N - 1\\)\nFor each of these Sums of Squared deviations, we can standardize them using the degrees of freedom. The notion here is that with more samples, and more treatments, we will have greater \\(SS\\) values. However, if we standardize these parameters by the \\(df\\), we can come up with a standardized Mean Squared values (simplified as \\(MS = \\frac{SS}{df}\\) for each level).\nIf we look at all these values, we can create the venerable ANOVA table with Among, Within, and Total partitions of the variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\ndf\nSS\nMS\n\n\n\n\nAmong\n\\(K-1\\)\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^K N_i \\left( \\bar{x}_i - \\bar{x} \\right)^2\\)\n\\(\\frac{SS_A}{K-1}\\)\n\n\nWithin\n\\(N-K\\)\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^Kn_i\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{N_i}(x_{ij}-\\bar{x}_i)^2 \\right)\\)\n\\(\\frac{SS_W}{N-K}\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(N-1\\)\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^K \\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} (x_{ij} - \\bar{x})^2\\)\n\n\n\n\nIn R, we can evaluate the equality of means by partitioning our data as depicted above. Essentially, if at least one of our treatments means deviate significantly, then the \\(MS_A\\) will be abnormally large relative to the variation within each treatment \\(MS_W\\). This gives us a statistic, defined by the American statistician Snedekor as:\n\\(F = \\frac{MS_A}{MS_W}\\)\nas an homage to Ronald Fisher (the F-statistic) has a pretty well understood distribution under a few conditions. This statistic has an expectation of:\n\\(f(x | df_A, df_W) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{(df_Ax)^{df_A}df_W^{df_W}}{(df_Ax + df_W)^{df_W+df_A}}}}{x\\mathbf{B}\\left( \\frac{df_A}{2}, \\frac{df_W}{2} \\right)}\\)\nwhich is even more of a mess than that for the \\(t\\)-test! Luckily, we have a bit of code to do this for us.\nHere is an example using the Iris data. Here we test the hypothesis that the Sepal Lengths are all the same (e.g., \\(H_O: \\mu_{se} = \\mu_{ve} = \\mu_{vi}\\))\n\nfit.aov &lt;- aov( Sepal.Length ~ Species, data=iris)\nfit.aov\n\nCall:\n   aov(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\nTerms:\n                 Species Residuals\nSum of Squares  63.21213  38.95620\nDeg. of Freedom        2       147\n\nResidual standard error: 0.5147894\nEstimated effects may be unbalanced\n\n\nThe function called here, aov() is the one that does the Analysis of Variance. It returns an object that has the necessary data we need. To estimate the ANOVA table as outlined above we ask for it as:\n\nanova(fit.aov)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: Sepal.Length\n           Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \nSpecies     2 63.212  31.606  119.26 &lt; 2.2e-16 ***\nResiduals 147 38.956   0.265                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nwhich shows that the “Species” treatment are significantly different from each other, with an \\(F\\) statistic equal to \\(F = 119.3\\), which with 2 and 147 degrees of freedom is assigned a probability equal to \\(2e^{-16}\\), a very small value!\n\nPost-Hoc Tests\nWhat this analysis tells us is that at least one of the treatment means are different from the rest. What it does not tell us is which one or which subset. It could be that I. setosa is significantly smaller than both I. versitosa and I. virginia. It could be that I. virginia is significantly larger than the others, who are not different. It could also mean that they are all different. To address this, we can estimate a post hoc test, to evaluate the difference between treatment means within this model itself.\nOne of the most common ways to evaluate the equality of treatment mean values is that defined by Tukey. The so-called “Honest Significant Differences” post hoc test is given by\n\ntuk &lt;- TukeyHSD(fit.aov)\ntuk\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\n$Species\n                      diff       lwr       upr p adj\nversicolor-setosa    0.930 0.6862273 1.1737727     0\nvirginica-setosa     1.582 1.3382273 1.8257727     0\nvirginica-versicolor 0.652 0.4082273 0.8957727     0\n\n\nwhich breaks down the pair-wise differences in the mean of each treatment. Here we see the magnitude of the differences in mean values, the lower and upper confidence on the differences, and the probability associated with these differences. In this example, all three comparisons are highly unlikely (e.g., \\(P\\) is very small and in this case essentially zero). As a result, we can interpret these results as suggesting that each of the three species have significantly different. If we plot these results, we see which ones are larger and which are smaller.\n\nplot( tuk )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich shows the difference between treatment mean between all pairs of treatments. Overall, we see that the Iris species are all significantly different."

Introduction to Environmental Studies I. &lt;3&gt; Hours.\n\n\nor match to digits, punctuation, or letters (one or more) using the shorthand .+ notation. It is the period that matches anything and the plus that does one or more of them.\n\nstr_view( envs101, \".+\")\n\n[1] │ &lt;ENVS 101. Introduction to Environmental Studies I. 3 Hours.&gt;\n\n\nThis becomes helpful a bit later when we are trying to anchor the course designation (e.g., ENVS 101) at the start, ONE OR MORE THING IN THE MIDDLE, and then the end of the line with the number of hours (e.g., 3 Hours.)\n\n\nPositional Matching\nWhere the items is in the string may be of importance to us. For example, consider another line in the data that specifies ENVS101 as a prerequisite. It does not come from a line of text that is the title of the course, it just also happens to match the 4 uppercase letters, space, and three digits pattern.\n\nstr_view( envs[37], \"[:upper:]{4}[:space:][:digit:]{3}\")\n\n[1] │ Semester course; 2 lecture hours. 2 credits. Prerequisites: &lt;ENVS 101&gt;\n\n\nThis is where the position in the line may be of interest.\n\nTo match things that occur at the beginning of the string, we prepend the pattern with the carat symbol.\n\n\nstr_view( envs101, \"^[:upper:]{4}[:space:][:digit:]{3}\")\n\n[1] │ &lt;ENVS 101&gt;. Introduction to Environmental Studies I. 3 Hours.\n\n\nThis matches our first line but not a line where this pattern does not occur in the beginning of the string.\n\nstr_view( envs[37], \"^[:upper:]{4}[:space:][:digit:]{3}\")\n\n\nFor the end of the string, we use the dollar sign to anchor it to the end.\n\n\nstr_view( envs[37], \"[:upper:]{4}[:space:][:digit:]{3}$\")\n\n[1] │ Semester course; 2 lecture hours. 2 credits. Prerequisites: &lt;ENVS 101&gt;\n\n\nwhich is not in the envs101 string\n\nstr_view( envs101, \"[:upper:]{4}[:space:][:digit:]{3}$\")\n\n\n\nPutting it Together\nSo, now let’s pull this all together and see if we can match: 1. The course designation at the start of the line. 2. The title 3. The end of the line with the number of hours.\n\nstr_view( envs101, \"^[:upper:]{4} [:digit:]{3}.*[:digit:] Hours.$\")\n\n[1] │ &lt;ENVS 101. Introduction to Environmental Studies I. 3 Hours.&gt;\n\n\nSo, there is one little extension—and this a common theme we’ve run across—and that has to do with the fact that programmers are a bit lazy. You can subsititue, the square-bracket-colon-word-colon-square-bracket for the following:\n\n[0-9] is shorthand for [:digits:].\n[a-z] is shorthand for [:lower:].\n\n[A-Z] is shorthand for [:upper:].\n\nWhich means that we can go from\n\npattern &lt;- \"^[:upper:]{4} [:digit:]{3}.*[:digit:] Hours.$\"\n\nto this\n\npattern &lt;- \"^[A-Z]{4} [0-9]{3}.+[0-9] Hours.$\"\n\nas our seach pattern.\n\nstr_view( envs101, pattern )\n\n[1] │ &lt;ENVS 101. Introduction to Environmental Studies I. 3 Hours.&gt;\n\n\nInstead of asking a single line, we need to apply this expressions to each line in the data an return the ones that match. For this, we can use grepl, which returns a TRUE/FALSE on matching. The tricky thing here is that the pattern comes first and the vector second (reverse from what we’ve been using.)\nSo for our data, we see\n\ngrepl(pattern, envs )\n\n  [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n [25] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n [49] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n [61] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n [85] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n [97] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[109] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n[121] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[133] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[145] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[157] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[169] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[181] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[193] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[205] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[217] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n[229] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[241]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[253] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nWhich is great as we can use it for extracting the lines of the data that have our information. Let’s use the grepl as indices and grab the titles from envs using it.\n\nidx &lt;- grepl( pattern, envs )\nenvs[idx] -&gt; titles\ntitles\n\n [1] \"ENVS 101.

We can get some kinds of overlays using text() or points() or lines() but there is not a cohesive framework for setting this up. For even moderately complex graphical display, these approaches become unwieldy when we have to cram all that information into extra optional arguments.\nConsider the graph below whose data are from a 2011 article in The Economist measuring human development and perception of corruption for 173 countries (Figure 1). Both the amount of data and the way in which the data are displayed (physically and aesthetically) are somewhat complex.\nFigure 1: Corruption and Human Develoment among OECD countries from The Economist magazine.\nThis graphic is constructed from several additive components1 including:\nTruth be told (and you can look at the RMD of this file to verify), this one graphic required 42 relatively terse lines of code to construct! If all of that code was stuffed into the optional arguments for a few functions, I think I would go mad.\nLuckily for us, there are people who spend a lot of time working on these issues and thinking about how to best help us effectively display data. One of these individuals was Leland Wilkinson, whose book The Grammar of Graphics defined just such a system.\nThis philosophy has been inserted into the R Ecosystem by Hadley Wickham in the ggplot2 library, which is descbribed as:\nThroughout the majority of this course, we will be using this library and this approach for all but the most trivial of graphical displays."

For simplicity, we do not need to make special data objects with just the variables we want to plot, we can pass around the whole data.frame object and just indicate to ggplot which ones we want to use by specifying the aesthetics to be used.\n\nggplot( iris , aes( x=Sepal.Length ) )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, there is enough information to make an axis in the graph because the underlying data has been identified. What has not been specified to date is the way in which we want to represent the data. To do this, we add geometries to the graph. In this case, I’m going to add a histogram\n\nggplot( iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length) ) + geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have a base graph!"

What I mean by this is:\n\nIf the data and aes() is in the the ggplot() function, then everything in the whole plot inherits that assignment.\nIf you put them in one or more of the components you add to ggplot() then the they are localized to only those layers.\n\nSo the following statements are all identical for this most basic of plots.\n\nggplot( iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length) ) + geom_histogram()\nggplot( iris ) + geom_historgram( aes(x=Sepal.Length) )\nggplot() + geom_histogram( aes(x=Sepal.Length), data=iris)\n\n\nIn the first case, the geom_histogram() inherits both data and aesthetics from ggplot().\n\nIn the second one, it inherits only the data but has it’s own specification for aesthetics.\nIn the last one, ggplot() only specifies the presence of a graph and all the data and aesthetics are localized within geom_histogram() function.\n\nWhere this becomes important is when we want to make more complicated graphics like the one above. The data that has the country CDI and HDI also has the names of the countries. However, only a subset of the country names are plot. This is because both the geometric layer and the text layer that has the names are using different data.frame objects.\nHere is a more simplistic example where I overlay a density plot (as a red line) on top of the histogram.\n\nggplot( iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length) ) + geom_histogram() + geom_density( col=\"red\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the geom_histogram and the geom_density use the same data and same specification for how to deal with the y-axis. However, the density is depicted as a frequency on the y-axis whereas the histogram uses counts. Also notice how the col=\"red\" is localized just for the geom_density() layer.\nWe can override the way in which geom_histogram uses the y-axis by changing the aesthetics for that particular geometric layer. Here, I’m goint to add another aes() just within the geom_histogram() function and have it treat y as the density rather than the count (yes that is two periods before and after the word density).\n\nggplot( iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length) ) + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) + geom_density( col=\"red\" )\n\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, everything inside the ggplot() function call is inherited by all the remaining components unless it is specifically overridden. Here is a more pedantic version where only the raw data.frame is in the ggplot and the rest is in each of the geometric layers.\n\nggplot( iris ) + \n  geom_histogram( aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=..density..) ) + \n  geom_density( aes(x=Sepal.Length), col=\"red\", lwd=2)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`."

In cases like this, where there is a an actual column of data that we want to use to change the appearance (e.g., in this case the Species column), we can put this within the aes() directly and ggplot() will handle the specifics for you.

What gives? Here is a simple rule.\n\nIf information from within the data.frame is needed to customize the display of data then it must be designated within the aes(), whereas if the display of the data is to be applied to the entire geometric layer, it is specified outside of the aes() call.\n\nHere is an example, where I have the color of the shapes determined by a value in the data.frame but have the shape2 applied to all the points, independent of any data in the data.frame.\n\nggplot( iris ) + geom_point(aes( x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, col=Species), shape=5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can build these things in an iterative fashion making things easier to read.
